61 companies in the S&amp;P 500 currently have a market cap of &lt;$8.9, which again is just the one day change in BTC's market cap!
The 14% decline has destroyed roughly $8.9bn in market cap value for bitcoin, the same as $CMG's current market cap in total.
That 14% decline is the biggest since January 14, 2015, when BTC dropped 22.5%; it's worse than 98.1% of trading days since 2010.

LFPR down but prime-age EPOP up, broad UER declines, and notable drops in part-time slack measures = okay report, not bad.

LFPR: disappointing, but increase in prime-age EPOP mitigates the 0.2% decline. UER: natural UER is clearly WAY lower than FOMC estimates.
