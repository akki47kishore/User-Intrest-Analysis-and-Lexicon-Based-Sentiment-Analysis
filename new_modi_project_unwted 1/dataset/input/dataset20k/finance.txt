61 companies in the S&amp;P 500 currently have a market cap of &lt;$8.9, which again is just the one day change in BTC's market cap!
The 14% decline has destroyed roughly $8.9bn in market cap value for bitcoin, the same as $CMG's current market cap in total.

LFPR down but prime-age EPOP up, broad UER declines, and notable drops in part-time slack measures = okay report, not bad.

LFPR: disappointing, but increase in prime-age EPOP mitigates the 0.2% decline. UER: natural UER is clearly WAY lower than FOMC estimates.

This tweet was specific to March reports.
Correction: final month here should read "Mar", not "Jan".
Of the 93 prior NFP reports during this expansion, 16 have missed estimates by as much or more than the March number.
The headline establishment NFP number was a stinker and retail is clearly in trouble but as a whole this was a very solid report.
Declines in measures of underemployment: part-time for economic and uneconomic reasons both dropped.
Younger workers continue to key gains in employment with 25-34s dding 413k jobs (vs +472k for all ages in the household survey).
Of the four education brackets, all saw significant UER drops/jobs gains EXCEPT those with a college degree or higher.
Unemployment amongst those w/ less than a HS diploma crashes to 689k (6.8%) from 806k (7.9%) in Feb.
Worst two months for retail industry job creation since December 2009.
Five of the last six NFP reports have been weaker than expected.  This from our employment report preview yesterday. https://t.co/qXoKICLG1z

Jan +43
Feb +59
Jan +6

Weather likely a big factor here."
In Canada, jobs beat (+19.4k vs +5.7k exp/+15.3k prev) with both full and part-time jobs rising.
U6 below 9% is a big deal even if the headline jobs print was weak with large downside revisions.
"U6 UER 8.9% vs 9.2% prev
LFPR 63.0% vs 63.0% prev
Payrolls Revisions -38k for last two months."

@GaryHitzler yeah I'd wait but really like it a lot.
@colnago717 I wouldn't touch these E&amp
@RichtofenV so many better industrials to own:  $UTX $IR $SWK $LEA -$HDS  on any pullback.
@robertscutillo not sure they gave us a reason to go really long until they reign in expenses.  I get why they doing but limits op lev potl.
@AllanSmall_GTA underlying better than reported.  FX played a roll.  Core up 18%, Paid Clicks and CPCs decent.  YouTube on fire.
@jedi509 mixed - China reg and a not so hot Q keeps it in penalty box for a bit -- Just not sure who incremental buyer is right now...
@AllanSmall_GTA well - this is a pretty unfriendly mgmt. team with mult classes of stock.  so it is a data pt of change.
@BCEagle1974 v kind. Thank you.
@vaadantas we have been adding what we sold in the low 90s.

@TrinityAssetMan actually some higher - $CLR $OAS cut by 40%.  I'm more focused on that production growth - needs to come down.
@KymLang TY - yes v risky bc of the declining valuations of these assets.  $HES mgmt known as "cowboys" on hedges too. Not my cup of tea.
@KymLang trap 4now - they relying on selling midstream assets in Bakken for CF growth.  not hedged on oil either - which goes both ways.
$HES report disturbing with a miss on earnings, capex down 16% but oil production expected to grow 10-13% this year.  Expect others=same.
@JDR1024 OTR just downgraded it.  Have hear MAUs haven't improved q/q which will be the key data pt on Q.

@mroberts64 well - you have time and that is what you will need.  dividend is good and secure as well.
@feru012 yep
@davidmoble it does but I doubt she would do it.
@fermie7 still can buy - it's lagged big time to its peers. Tough on oil. Which ones?
@is_matrix flat yield curve hurts their investment book.
@davidmoble indeed.
@MrFlyTrap usually these kinds of big moves take a few days.  feb 3rd is eps date - should stabilize by then.

@orrinknox we playing $DG
@Michael_Khouw exactly - and why the visibility is pretty good for $SBUX and others.  we overweight consumer.
@KDaimler certainly could be in addition the west coast port issues limited inventories.  interesting that $FDX just reiterated guide.
$SBUX CEO "I don't think we've benefitted from lower oil prices yet...it will not happen overnight"
@musicandwork they bought energy assets at the peak - and now orders are falling rapidly.  disappointing bc 2015 s/h/been their year.
@RyWind certainly but they bought into oil at the wrong time imo - which will be a headwind they didn't expect.

@jackpat22 yes - let dust settle a few days but story still solid for 2015.
@CramersShirt West Coast port issue? Gift card strength? Or slower spend. Not clear from them.
@tomlucas6282 might mean gift card season was stronger.
Interesting tidbit from $AXP that December retail sales slowed from Oct/Nov - coincides with the recent govt figures.
@ETFGodfather lower euro, lower oil (25% of product costs) should help. plus EM exposure (60%) and strong mgmt.  Polman was at $PG!

Differing opinions on $OXY today - Sterne Agee upgrades to buy and GS resumes it with sell.
BAC buyers of $NKE ahead of Q expects 9-10% futures orders, mkt share gains &amp; margin upside.
UBS downgrades $UPS to hold on valuation. Yet stk has lagged FDX by 20% ytd. Buy opp imo.

@afuntanilla 10 yr bond yield+earlier in the week comments about FICC revs soft.
@JDH_1 is oversold but wont matter until oil stabilizes.
@CMcK39 no I really don't.  We need it to just stabilize.  That would be enough imo.
@dcwalsh388 less exposed to oil. great LT story.
@RedSquare27 wait for oil to stabilize
@vaadantas yes like the 2015 story a lot.
Wow huge cloud sub additions at $ADBE @ 644K vs 530K expectation.  Strategy transition totally humming.
@katiecnbc YES!  No clue when it bottoms - I just want to see stabilization first.
@Kelly_Evans but so many called the bottom!

@JDR1024 @jimcramer absolutely -that's also what Advent International brings to the table.  we've highlighted that in our AAP notes as well.
@JDR1024 @jimcramer not really a 3Q story, though - lowered guide expected and lower bar for 2015 as new product/lower invests kicks in.

$AXP - Cyber Monday was its single biggest billings day in history.
@AllanSmall_GTA you have to have oil prices stabilize.  simple as that imo.  capex is coming down in spades.
@AllanSmall_GTA but the recurring revs are more positive, returns still depressed, trades at 12x eps and 1.2x TBV.
@AllanSmall_GTA they have until 2019 - so no issue.  not down enuf yet to me.  prefer $MS.

@RichtofenV if capex budgets get hit they will be impacted - but they do have offsets including lower raw costs.
@RChang6 still prefer $CMI but they'll all benefit.

@Dan_Dicker only one?
JPM u/g $TJX - shares have lagged $ROST and due for a catch-up. LT trends remain favorable.  Also a way to play some Europe bounce.

Well u/g $UTX to outperform following yesterday's decline liking new CEO, potl cash distribution increases, valuation.

BAC/ML upgrades $KATE - raises earnings growth rate to 45%.  Expects sss of 16% comps and margin expansion.  Target $34.
@JDH_1 so hard bc ESV is so down/out and long time industry leader. New KMI powerhouse.
@David_Kudla great so I have a few yrs yet to pay you back.
BAC/ML sees small/medium bank mergers as "episodic" in 2015 w/ $FNFG $SNV $FHN --  ones to watch.
@David_Kudla well - I'm out a dollar.  nice set up!

Just so many better bank managements at this point with equally cheap/catalyst valuations. $C.
@jeffreyswaim @jimcramer @SquawkStreet totally agree. He did a few times. For the first time.
@jdgreenfield @jimcramer @SquawkStreet @BrianSozzi Was on it as well. Read our AAP note.
RT @jdgreenfield: @jimcramer @Stephanie_Link @SquawkStreet you should talk to @BrianSozzi ...he live tweeted the call and is a beast
@fedspecialists @CNBCFastMoney @karenfinerman So nice and the company with KF is humbling. Thank u.
@BrianSozzi @jimcramer @SquawkStreet this is just 1 of several steps 2continue growth. Great margins+dbl digit growth. #buythedip

@Syboutzen Commercial-Do it Yourself
@CramersShirt @DannyTiseo all macro - election/iron ore pricing headwinds.  easier ones out there that is for sure.
@DannyTiseo @CramersShirt yep just a bad call.
@pelotonresearch It's fun when the puzzle fits!
@BrianSozzi throw in $SHLD as well! but we also know there are others that are doing a lot better. $HD $LOW $AMZN $VFC...
GS upgrades $LOW to buy -- $SWK was a good tell for both $HD/$LOW with better CDIY results.
@FaceplantJim well - the surprising thing -- is he was actually really good, imo.  so I'd wait.
@danielpronych nope but they used their high currency at the time, still have $14 billion in cash, and finding growth longer term.
@Paul_Jaqua yeah agree - all is not perfect but progress.
@visigoth67 lol
@415AJAYM415 Cash deployment = more mid 2015/2016 event. Thought Q was solid on margins/vols/guide. Was up 3% yest so a little more muted.
$PNRA - 2 encouraging trends: 3Q transaction growth highest level since 1Q 2012, Oct sss trends up 3.3% on 1 yr and 4.9% on 2 yr.
@ginzo10 actually prefer $FTNT and $SYMC vs these others
$ETN finally delivers but the real news is "significant cash deployment capacity by mid-year 2015".
@uwchlan yep wrote that last nite in our $FB quarter review.  $GOOGL should too after their solid Q.
$PAG added to the list of better than expected auto dealers w/ sss +11.2% w/17.5% rev growth.
5 buys and 1 neutral on $BABA today.
$FB quarter solid but a lot of good news priced in up 47% ytd.  Guide for expenses up 50-70% in 2015 - "heavy investment year".
@davidmoble sorta think there are a lot of options.  and if nothing, activism.  imo.
@StockMaul thanks partially offsets the TWTR bruise.  generally most industrials doing quite well during eps season.  still like $LEA to.
@mroberts64 Valuable southeast exposure, asset sales, underperformed peers/attractive valuation and 4.3% dividends. I like it a lot here.
@vaadantas made my day - thanks.
@GraduateInvestr yep - agree.  would add it along with the others I mentioned.
@JDR1024 thx - absurd reaction.
@GraduateInvestr Agreed still like the basket $GOOGL $FB $TWTR.
@JormaStarratt and still do actually
@mnttrust71  no haven't been in a while - but watching it.
@visigoth67 I agree - capex budgets will be revised lower below $80.
@bvrm1975 was a hack unfortunately.  I run every day - my outlet.
@HowardPetrie I didn't send it - guess hack. Thanks.
@RChang6 nah it was a hack.  thx for letting me know.
GS lowers 2015 WTI price to $74/bbl - expects 6% drop in customer activity vs 9% gains previously. Cuts view from attractive to cautious.
@EVplusEV I guess so -thanks
@jfeigus secularly it is right.
@jjrog3 there is a lot of love for it into the print.  not the best risk/reward imo.
@ronnycastro bc its so small and down a lot already.  like the valuation/co specifics at these levels.
@jjrog3 very high
@coolwave7 I am a little nervous on $FB expectations - rec'd trimming some for AAP earlier this week.  $TWTR not as high x but we'll see.
@feru012 u nailed the pullback - better than anyone I read.
@aztecs99 doubtful since they are mainly china at the moment.  think the big box retailers Omnichannel strategies starting to really work.
@TexasAlum pretty ugly eps. if it gets to 30 would be a good grab, imo.  for long term.
@jfeigus its not cheap and guide is pretty conservative.  I like it tho - picked it bc it did lag off the strong report.
@StockMaul if you think Neves wins.
@ronnycastro depends on your risk profile.  obviously its going to react based on what happens on Sunday.
@RedSquare27 want oil to stabilize first.  rather miss the first 5 pts vs catch another knife in energy.
@musicandwork yes I would have liked to see higher bill spend.  it was solid and I still like.  just think $AXP h/more op leverage for 2015.
@vaadantas yes - cheap, M&amp;A synergies, activism, lower gas prices, better negotiation scale w PBMs.
@GraduateInvestr still loaded with them.
@musicandwork rare disappointment but x were a touch high.  prefer $AXP given its p/b but still like $DFS.
@Stockmarket_Kid agree still own/like the basket - $TWTR $FB $GOOGL and thinking $BABA.

@JDR1024 might take some $FB gains. Wrote yesterday about it. Restricted.
@dcwalsh388 not at all. Have written extensively about it. But down 20% since last Q. Show me story.
@keith_inchierca like the simplified structure and yield one of the stronger ones.
@TexasAlum +6.2% from last week lows is a quick move. Oil/dollar running things at the moment.
@PattyPalooza895 sort of think at these levels bad 3Q is known. Cheap w/ superior mgmt.
@FaceplantJim yes I do - oil/dollar also reversed too bringing commodities down.  +6.2% from last week's lows was pretty fast, imo...

Impressive Q from CSX w carloads up 7%, yields up 1% and op ratio @ 69.7% - 2nd sub 70% 3Q since 2010.
And it starts - UBS and BAC/ML lower oil company estimates on the soft commodity, weak activity in Europe/ME, currency.  At least x are low.
@TexasAlum btw - UT almost pulled it off.  finally watched it this am!
@DannyTiseo yes think that is why they are trading where they are.  $ESV has said $80 Brent threshold.
@jfeigus pretty high bar set and well owned.  costs, FICC, Cap Mkts, loan growth the focus for me.
@JGN74 If Indonesia govt doesn't increase investment partnership it will be a cut.
@mhenderson33 not really - the d/g were of the ones that have outperformed and not cheap.  plenty of cheaper ones to own.
@TexasAlum interesting time in the mkt...  watch oil.  needs to stabilze.  but eps will be good and more opportunities being created.
@JGN74 look at the entire group - all commods down.  FX, Europe, and they've been amazing performers.
@RedSquare27 need oil to stabilize for stocks to have more than a one day bounce.

BAC/ML puts $PNRA on the US 1 List - best investment ideas.  Target $185.  Much of investment spend behind sets up for a strong 2015.
@phippsjm guess that means I really like it.
@CramersShirt for higher eps power you really need steeper yield curve so until then its cost cuts, special sitches.  we there tho.

@JDR1024 $GOOGL
@cirrusdriver crappy services, spotty coverage? that's worth it.
@CharlieWiseCPA there is a lot they can fix and stock/investors expect nothing.  I like that trade off.
@cirrusdriver agreed!
$MCD acts well following the 5% dividend boost last nite - which was viewed as a disappointment.  More s/h actions coming imo.
China PBOC does more to stabilize/stimulate its economy  high http://t.co/MbjYlI6yr5
@feru012 Have consistently been behind it.  Double? That's bold.
@colnago717 Hmm - really?  Can't we dream a little....?
@AdaptToReality for many years of course but not recently. v choppy for the last few.  I think its good. cloud #1 priority. w/take time.
@wboscoho pretty much Catz/Hurd have both been but this gives them a little more breathing room, imo.
@AdaptToReality when it was run by an egomaniac distracted by other things?  plenty of examples actually.
Ellison hasn't gotten it done consistently in a while.  Hurd/Catz are sharp and can get to it.  Cloud/buyback better.  Hardward bad.  $ORCL.
@fedeacevedo I don't think its a big deal but I would hold. Esp if LT.  Great quality company, aero still in mid innings, out of favor=opp.

@GraduateInvestr I got plenty.
@jynole @jimcramer @HedgeyeHWP nope
@TigernBham have never like it - have you been in their stores?  $WAG is the contrarian play imo.  preferred.
@ianfirestone basket of all
Boutique firm CRT initiates $BABA with a buy and $95 target.  Favorite internets are $BAB $FB $GOOGL.
@9hhsc general cycle peaking concerns. Still like the group.
@JDR1024 in theory but as I've said repeatedly it is show me story w/this CEO.
@HowardPetrie didn't say they were -- NA=North America.

@CramersShirt @cirrusdriver yeah have added a few discresh names lately bc of it.
@AllanSmall_GTA no I'm going the $MCD route in the consumer discresh value play.  any chance they just shut TGT Canada?  w/b ++ imo.

GM To Boost Output Of Mid-sized Pickups In U.S., Add Jobs http://t.co/fEq1c8lXcH
@AllanSmall_GTA this biz makes you a morning person even if you're not... a nice early am run usually helps.
@pd701 ideally 125 which is the last time we bought it ahead of 1Q.  would let settle.
@chair13 look at the entire energy complex and add on rising rates.
@RChang6 have said same.
@KSmith12489664 don't need to own them all!
Contrarian call - Stifel u/g $TEX to buy.
@SteveCaru a lot of good is expected.  we sold it 2 weeks ago.  mid/low 90s would buy it back.
@RChang6 we made money in it.  sold it mid 150s. trading sort of name.
Barclays lowers $OXY to equal from overweight - limited catalysts and no premium for US assets/sale.
Wells Fargo d/g $CMI to mkt perform from outperform. Expects numbers to come down on soft power gen demand.
@AllanSmall_GTA yes, but cyclicals aren't usually bought when they are cheap - as you know...  trough eps vs peak.
@nickmaier16 nope still restricted - in fact just today!
@AllanSmall_GTA been such a good performer - tough one just yet.
@AllanSmall_GTA most below 1x TBV.  we added $AIG recently back into the port.  $HIG $PRU $MET all good ones too.
@AllanSmall_GTA will be helped by higher rates.
@FaceplantJim Hi - the deal is Friday so would be done for the most part (imo) by then.
@learnintotrade expect volatility in front of Alibaba deal - but yes I like it.
@cirrusdriver would do it for free!
@Issaquahfunds thank you
$JCI announces Building Efficiency (HVAC) reorganization - will separate North America from International ops.  This is step one imo.
@hightideSC $DOW $RDS.A are fine, $FCX will take some patience and $ETN either Cutler executes or goes.  $ESV wildcard but yield +.

@OptionsHawk for now on fins... I'm there/spades.  and yeah MCD is ripe for it.  ty.
@KymLang one bad group I've avoided. cant get valuation to make sense.  yet.
@OptionsHawk debated on FMHT and blogged $MCD - nice to have company.  where you see rates headed? been waiting all year...
@KymLang woe.
@OptionsHawk been a while on fins - will be interesting to see if it can continue. surprised discresh not pos w/oil down so much?
@hightideSC throw in $ESV for good measure and forget any of the good ones.
Apple iPhone 6 Plus pre-orders sold out, smaller iPhone 6 still shipping next week http://t.co/MbZcRc3odH
@feru012 yep plus fairly positive commentary from them at Barclays this week.
@trinh_pham13 yeah we trimmed last Friday - dollar headwinds, supply, soft demand.  but again, like it for restructuring so w/bb lower.
@trinh_pham13 took gains - not a bad thing to do.  would buy back on p/b.
@JGN74 read our notes - restrictions and also selectively adding in general.
@JDR1024 we'll see - but it seems $ESV bounces nicely at 46-47.  yield.
@cirrusdriver BIG blinks.
@VendbienJon lol - tech issues on my end.
@GraduateInvestr giving you a chance to add. we would if we could - restricted.

@FaceplantJim I like the SE regional exposure, places for further cost cuts, and its strong bal sheet.  Wrote a note late in day yest on it.
$HUN worth a look following both a $C upgrade and higher ests from BAC/ML - asset sales/restructuring story on track.
@FaceplantJim ahh - well there are no fins (or stocks) immune from the macro but the smaller banks s/fare better on this latest round.
@FaceplantJim you mean Cramer and Link report?  :)
@JDR1024 should act better given non resi data points.  watching it closely.
@GraduateInvestr thank you!
@GraduateInvestr I like the group - leaning towards the laggards like $BAC $AIG $MTB $AXP.
@jjones5533 package of both + $GOOGL makes sense to me, imo.
@cirrusdriver not for lack of trying elsewhere!
Long $CAT bull at BAC downgrades to neutral - thesis played out. Nailed it with the u/g at $80.  Now prefers $JOY.
$TWTR upgrade at UBS - launch of promoted video ads, "buy now" button, intl rollout &amp; opex opps.  Target $65.
@MarkMcCabe95 well it's been a wild ride for sure - but new CEO s/b a pos catalyst and in the end they are still in the security mix.
@MarkMcCabe95 especially since it was expected they would release a payments product.  that said, it's pretty impressive imo.
@WD_15717 @danmicovic @OptionAlarm much noise. interesting the analyst actually raised his ests but said no profit impact from new products.
And here come the $EBAY downgrades following  $AAPL's new mobile payment news.  Piper lowers to neutral.
Boutique firm Atlantic Equities upgrades $COH to overweight. New mgmt., new products, low x.
Pacific Crest d/g $AAPL to sector perform from outperform - much good news priced into shares.
@JDR1024 read our take.

@KeithM8140 read my note - its longer term but while you wait you get a 3.5% yield + it will be raised likely 9/25 + leveraging bal sheet.
@cirrusdriver All caps = too early in the morning!
@frankchairman yep ugly as expected - like it on this p/b.
@KeithM8140 of course - that's where I see opp tho.
@cirrusdriver LOL-silly these package food cos are in a world of hurt &amp

Applaud $GIS buying growth &amp; more "better for you" products but 21.8x EV/EBITDA seems a little rich even for a co w/12% CAGR.
@KeithM8140 2 separate entities - and the stock is down 10% from the highs.  price for everything.  x today's num t/b ugly.  p/b to buy.
@davidmoble indeed.
@frankchairman I sort of think so and yield support too.
@frankchairman gotta get thru 9/9 sss which w/b ugly but 9/25 s/see dividend boost and further leverage data pts.
@JDR1024 agree - tmrw will be ugly but like a pullback if we get:  http://t.co/ZCjjz1S0SZ

@OptionsHawk @SconnieTrader there is plenty of hate for this group - no doubt.
@OptionsHawk @hmeisler yes but it's the best operator, youngest fleet of the big 3, technology superior, strongest balance sheet.
yes was noteworthy! RT @hmeisler: Stephanie_Link @OptionsHawk The reversal on Friday on volume makes it even more enticing. $ESV
@OptionsHawk so the interesting thing about $ESV - is it now yields 6.4% and CEO has reiterated 2x in the last month their commitment to it.
@joseph_larson we have plenty of aero exposure and on a relative basis prefer $UTX.  $BA doesn't have NT catalysts but LT good company.

@AllanSmall_GTA $BAC just got CCAR approval 2 weeks ago for the dividend increase - first in 7 years.  No bb approval (didn't apply).
@cirrusdriver thought so too. group acts bad tho. frustrating.

@elmatadortrader  @BRLTweets $EWZ is up today.  all commods down today - more macro.  $FCX $SCCO $RIO $BHP
@AllanSmall_GTA $ABBV/Shire combo good fit w/nice yield and like the p/b in each WAG UPS AXP - sort of out of favor-ness too.
@AllanSmall_GTA still like auto parts - $LEA c/get mid teens, watching $ABBV low 50s, just bought $WAG $UPS $AXP on p/bs.

@AllanSmall_GTA aint that the truth...
@JLHose Europe will be tuf for all of them - but feel like $ORCL is washed out, low x, have catalysts like apps/hardware recovery to help.
@Armandod2013 Not an alarmist - just stating facts.  Have been buying the mkt weakness after raising cash ahead of 2Q.
@phippsjm it's a big one for us already. adding to $UTX.
@davidmoble yes sss is pretty much the key but I will also say gross margins are impt.
@tct12044 I think as they execute on 75%/25% industrial-fin mix the stock grinds higher.
$GE maybe closer to appliance sale after all. Electrolux said t/b interested. C/b worth $1-2 bil.
$WY raises divi 32% &amp
@afuntanilla $STI
$CSCO doesnt see growth in Emerging Mkts for several quarters - may see declines.
@FaceplantJim thanks! We'll see tmrw how all shakes out.
@RChang6 Yeah when it yields 3% its more interesting.
@buckdeerstocks4 indeed
@CramersShirt funny - they are predictable for sure!
$DE 2014 guide not surprising but pretty ugly: Ag sales x down 10% w/ US &amp; Canada down 10%, SA down 15% &amp; Asia flat.
@shahjitemi exactly - more to fix/low hanging fruit too.
@CramersShirt $PVH has exposure to all three...  That's the one we've been buying.  But its still show me story.
@CarmeloRandazz0 absolutely.
Will be interesting to see those $JCP numbers and if the share take back from $M is happening as quickly as x.
@cimdog747 quality company and strong management. Not cheap but for a reason.
Key remains positive on Construction Equipment &amp; Rental names:  $HEES $OSK $TEX $URI. Pos from ABI, resi/non resi spend, energy/chem demand.

@MrFlyTrap not much Harold.  only bc the 1Q was so strong and we knew it was pull forward demand.  just a stupid decision by BOJ.
@gstergio @KymLang well -- if rates move - regionals are the ones that would move hardest given the hit they've taken ytd. most levered.
@gstergio @KymLang thought it in January when US econ data started to really get better. we'll see... haven't given up.
@gstergio @KymLang Got some time but Jackson Hole could b catalyst. We patient &amp
@GCuse1 agreed 100%.
Brilliant move by the BOJ to raise taxes.  Just brilliant. RT @zerohedge: Japan Q2 GDP -6.8%, Exp. -7.0%
@GCuse1 3% would be a good number.  they are profitable here but more profitable there.
@KymLang exactly - interesting contra-indicator would be rates are bottoming, econ getting better so last place u want to be= uts/high yield
@KymLang uts like the flat yield curve bc they are more competitive when rates are low with their above ave yields.  hence the interest.
@KymLang @cirrusdriver its just not that complicated - spread biz suffers when yield curve is stubbornly flat.  that said, some can do well.
@KymLang as long as rates are where they are - tuf space.  no matter what the WSJ said today.
@davidmoble I've always liked the margin structure and high end focus of $TOL.  Can always do $SWK $MAS as well.
Huge reversal in $KATE - drop in margins overtake double digit comps and guide up.
@MrFlyTrap I would actually just buy $PCLN.  The story is just beginning the next leg w/Kayak and OpenTable.
@davidmoble $PRU $AIG $MET.  $HIG cheap but more P/C.
@TigernBham its a credibility thing - mgmt. reiterated all positives in May and then blew Q. but yeah - down here btr risk/reward.
@timmysheetz own/like the supplier to them - $PVH.  Top custs are $JCP $KSS $M.
Boutique firm u/g $JCP - expects higher sss to partially offset the GM pressures.
@CramersShirt like clock work.
DB u/g $TSLA to buy - higher production expectations and profitability.  Target $310.
$DE estimates lowered into Q @ Longbow - weakness in Ag mkt on lower prices and high inventory levels persist.  X pretty low into the print.
$WMT downgraded to hold from Jefferies. Investment strategy not working to drive higher sales.
@Warrenweitzman Thank you. I don't - hip stress fracture years ago so tread only.
@RedSquare27 prefer $WFT $SLB but they've all run so much.
@OptionsHawk I like $WDR - think the mgmt. turnover concern is overdone. M/b $GS gets them on the cheap - like the strategy if true.
@OptionsHawk hearing several asset mgmt. firms being looked at by them.
@AllanSmall_GTA it helps to clear the mind! exercise is great at any time!
@davidhodge55 prolly following you when we can...
Just wait until $YUM posts their China numbers.
@cirrusdriver righto I forgot the world was collapsing.
Auto parts companies continue to outperform - $MGA beats  on top/bottom line with margin expansion, raises outlook for NA and Europe demand.
@gstergio happy birthday!
@gstergio yes
@MrFlyTrap I like what they are doing to expand vertically in a variety of segments.  At 20x forward its attractive w/30% + bookings growth.
@GCuse1 all of the banks w/ the 10 yr breaking 2.4%.
RT @bespokeinvest: If 10-year yield breaks 2.4%, not much support until all the way down at 2.1%.
@feru012 we raised some extra cash but finding that several sectors have already p/b 10-15%...  picking slowly.
@Amahesh777 I think we need to see a new CEO - sounds like by end of September.  And then we'll get the strategy changes...
@Stockmarket_Kid I basically just said the same thing.  I am happy to have raised some cash.  Watching it closely.
ty! RT @JLHose: @Stephanie_Link love the new AAP "Portfolio" page design.  A great improvement.
@TigernBham high expectations - worth buying the dip when they stabilize. $COST low 110s we'll add.
@Stockmarket_Kid it won't take much to tip it back over.  worth watching for sure.  we have a little extra cash in any case.
@rtwhite11 not yet - ag cycle on the decline.
"$COST core sss in line at 5.8% -- average ticket +1.5% vs -.5% 12 month

Stifel u/g $CHK on pullback. Still positioned for better production growth and stronger resource mix.

@johnburkholder I like $TIME.  Sorta in that family.
@fedeacevedo not a chart person.  fundamentals slowly improving macro-wise but elections will be key.  internals at co never been better.
@acestock some stocks of quality are down 10% plus. See opp.
@MrFlyTrap want to buy it when dust settles.
@GCuse1 own it/holding it - $17 bil at high end but good to get it behind them.  need rates higher for the real pos operating leverage.
@MrFlyTrap yes we are restricted. not broken and oversold.  will take so patience tho - limited near term catalysts.
@gstergio $17 bil was high end (heard $20 rumored last week). gotta get it behind them and move on.  higher rates = the real help.
@acestock $SWK (HD/LOW 30% of their CDIY) said spring hurt on weather but end of Q started to see improvement.
@JDR1024 diff animals. Both need higher rates. Still like $MTB a lot.
@acestock dunno we have the most cash we've had in a while. Just now picking at stuff.
@TigernBham good day to buy $WAG
@TexasAlum sorta think August is going to be like this - macro over takes micro.  but picking away at some stuff after raising cash.
@whittcharles still like it - 1Q out of the box and #s were all over the lot.
$BAC raises dividend for the first time in 7 years -- following revised CCAR approval from Fed.

RT @michaelsantoli: Wrote last week we're deep into the financial-engineering phase of the cycle. Gears of that machine lost a few teeth....
@GCuse1 sold $JPM and bought $AXP w it down 10% from highs. better value less headline risk.  waiting on $BAC CCAR news but remains a 3.
Wells u/g $BBT to buy - valuation and high quality portfolio/loan book.
Bernstein u/g $GE to outperform - valuation, solid organic growth, portfolio changes.
@sawky indeed - really like that story as well.
$FOXA pulls $TWX bid and shares rally 9%.  Stock h/b hammered on the deal.  Still has strong assets/brand either way.
@Amahesh777 not sure eps will matter a whole lot - gotta get CEO/strategic direction of where they headed.
@davidhodge55 restricted
@JGN74 maybe but not sure there is a rush.  retail is very mixed and better operators on p/b are more interesting to me. $COST $M $PVH $VFC
Classic new CEO action - $TGT numbers lowered.  A lot to fix yet in US product-wise and need a real Canadian strategy.
MS resumes $FOXA with overweight w/ $37 target.  Big laggard on $TWX deal. Like asset mix either way.
@Armandod2013 yeah expectations c/not have been lower for it.  still a lot of wood to chop and gotta see the new products in Sept.
he is and one of the best  RT  @ReformedBroker @ScottMoudry: Stephanie_Link how can we get Josh Brown on twitter!
@RavensTide v close on $AXP
@pc81000 wouldnt call this exactly early...  $ESV yield will help.  it is secure.
MS upgrades $OXY to buy - it's new top pick and d/g $CVX.  Better risk/reward given growth prospects.
@dmrocha1024 @jimcramer thank you. Takes 3 days!
@visigoth67 yeah whenever that is. We have ample fin exposure. Took gains. Prudent.
@rcat20sk @apppro1 taking gains in this mkt makes sense. W/bb low 50s.
@Stockmarket_Kid i think for certain it would impact.  dollar strength is more impactful.

@trinh_pham13 @CramersShirt funny.  I have never said $PNRA was a short term call.... I have always said invest w/pay off.  LT.
@CramersShirt high expectations vs low.  earnings power after these investments is pretty sizable.  reminds me of $PVH.  gotta by low.
@CramersShirt Q not good - but don't you think so much bad is baked in?  its not a high flyer -- in fact anything but...
@vaadantas I like it but more on a p/b.
@JDR1024 agree
@frankchairman $BA Q was just so/so and the charge was the surprise/disappointment.  $CAT fell on news but now $2.5 b accelerated bb +.
@RedSquare27 let this settle.  the real news is the spin of vehicles isn't happening this yr.  AAP note out following the call.
@potashrules sold $CMI ahead of the Q fortunately, unfortunately held $ETN. 2 AAP notes are out.
@cruisinaway very ho-hum but over time shift to more industrial mix s/help. IPO this week, spin next yr.  Immelt needs to deliver...
@RChang6 have been selling industrials - got fortunate on $CMI but not $ETN.  $ETN more is about the lack of Vehicle spin imo.
@colnago717 thought the Q was solid - surprised at the decline.

@MisterMainSt might surprise you - $MA $GM.  might a pop get for $WFM.
@AllanSmall_GTA yeah was sorta my point.
@JDR1024 quality was low w/other income, lower tax helping. engines disappointed which is the sweet spot of the cycle.
@davidmoble own/like $CI a lot. also the restructuring at $WLP.  rest a little rich.

@MrFlyTrap $STI is ranked higher! I like the secular growth story, the above average loan growth and further cost take outs.
@MrFlyTrap Tuf call. I do like $STI much better than $BAC but $BAC has lagged huge of the majors w/CCAR/settlement potn'l. $STI cleaner.
@hightideSC @XplosiveOptions @jimcramer and buying them all.
@Analyst1105 @zardboy123 guys this doesn't really trade on eps (too lumpy/costs) - bookings and pipeline much more impt. both were v strong.
@rshamie I think the Q will be very good.  It depends on the "sentiment" game.  Bc that is what this group trades on.
@RedSquare27 never be upset taking a gain.  1% or 100%.
@joseph_larson that would be a YES.

@robinstarz @CNBCFastMoney since April lows we were carefully adding but def did when things got extreme.
@robinstarz @CNBCFastMoney yes we did buy on the p/b - all the way down.
@robinstarz have traded few x - initially @$20 to $60. recent trade cost is $67 - still like it.  solid Q. short, med, LT catalysts.
@davidhodge55 have issues w credibility having missed last 3qs. But down here should bounce.
@nickmaier14 in the end - tuf to sell down this much.  but not much upside catalysts until 2nd half of their fiscal yr. if you believe them.

@nickmaier14 Mgmt reiterate all numbers, was pos China LTE, margins &amp;28 nm during conference season in spring. 180 degree turn last nite.

@GaryHitzler very low x into it.  they just need to do 68-70% gross margins imo.
@MrFlyTrap nah - not in front of August 10th CCAR plus valuation too cheap.
@nancyrenee2 at these levels I'd hold it for the dividend but hedge funds were counting on a $75 deal so w/b sloppy for a while.
@frankchairman they could. Think it's a good story for LT. Replacement cycle story, global demand, duopoly.
@afuntanilla have not been a fan on valuation/over owned but watching p/b. $KATE $ COH 2.
@frankchairman very disappointing. Not fundamentally driven in my view. Waiting on Q s/b good.

@JustinPulitzer yep - IWM IBB QNET all have started to reverse.  one reason we added to $FB earlier in the week.

$JPM 10-Q: Capital Mkts down 20% y/y - likely continued FICC pressure.  Russian exposure $4.7 bil.  More headwinds for mgmt.
@afuntanilla Let it settle - it is a vol one. but Imencouraged by Crane backlog, AWPs and customers in NA mkts.
@kamikaz55076267 $HIG is cheaper and knows how to outperform on fundamentals.
@FaceplantJim no - they've proven they cant keep costs under control and I wonder if $BRY transax isn't less than they thought.  we h/b out.

BAC/ML u/g $NBR to buy on further evidence of US land dayrate increases.  Also pos for $PTEN $HP $PD.
@TexasAlum we sold at $71 -didn't like the way it acted.  down here is v interesting for an industry leader w/ACA +.
@feru012 $GOOG acts bad.  Frustrating.
@OracleofWallSt thats about what i am thinking.
@TexasAlum Missed Q - just after last month's analyst day where they c/h set bar alot lower.  Cred.  EPS guide implies a big BB coming.
@OmahaHappyHrs $SWK if you can stomach vol.  Also think the drop in $JCI is absurd.
@Scott19707 ty - Q was solid w/beat across the board w/strong AUM. Fee income and expenses q/q were down. but seasonal.
@AlotHello lol. short hand!
@GMSATTY88 its disappointing that they just held an analyst meeting a month ago and could have set bar alot lower.  frustrating.
@OracleofWallSt this will take time, for sure.
@OmahaHappyHrsnever a doubt about valuation/yield but stock doesnt trade on fundies/more macro related.
@feru012 agreed
@JWUFL have liked $RDS.A for a while - low 70s.
@pepelemule hearing it's worth $1 bil.
@cirrusdriver most in a year

@nickmaier12 oh not at all trying to mask - we picked btn $49-$51.  just really don't like the action here.  after mkt confirms out...
Small bright spot in tonight's EPS carnage is $COST--  raises dividend.  Sometimes right down the middle is OK.
@CramersShirt give it a few.  always needs to settle. brutal evening from so many.
@CramersShirt absolutely it will.  but think they are doing the right things to fix it.
@johnnyb1329 Have long been an $ETN fan but think he is tired and last 3Qs underwhelming.  $EMR-- mid $60s or below. No need to pay up.
@CramersShirt But we knew that this would take a while.  The investments are just beginning.
@johnnyb1329 headwinds or tailwinds?
@Lsteve001 any time. always own up to picks.  contrarian by nature but uncomfortable with the action in shares.  too tuf.
@jonsteinberg $TWTR -user growth has been underwhelming for a while - even before they went public. $EBAY fundies h/b ignored from activism.
@RavensTide like them both - m/b lean on $UTX.
@Lsteve001 agreed much bad in the stock but the competitive pressures will weigh on stock from a sentiment perspective.  lacks NT catalysts.
@stam54 this is hardly new - and not the reason I like the stock.  new mgmt. team products in fall.  june 4th mtg.
@CraigScott31 Pretty surprising after recent analyst meeting.  EPS season pretty challenging.  Still like the LT secular trends.
$GE-Alstom deal likely announced tmrw - $12 billion.  EPS accretion roughly 10 cents.  Gets $GE more industrial exposure which is positive.
@drkbrownjr expected a bad Q and we got it in spades. still like it for the June 4th analyst day/new products in Sept. &amp
@is_matrix core earnings $564 mil  vs $476 mil consensus, revs up 17.2% y/y to $4.46 bil.  all lines up y/y.
@phippsjm they need your help!
@jedi509 have a note out - obviously a big surprise. 2nd issue under Moynihan. no rush to add.  restricted either way.
@SconsetCapital when you have gains in that one - you need to take them...  mid 70s gets interesting.
@tonyb1957 we've been selling over the last few weeks.  up 13% into the print.  do think today was overdone.  m/b getting back in.
Wow $TCS misses again on eps/revs  - 2nd time out of the gate.
@TweetLeni I think Luis &amp
@TweetLeni China hasn't been slowing for them.  Last Q up 25% as they still are strong over there.  It's more NA.  Again, not a play on Q.
@davidmoble they are both good.  $WFT on a tear lately on reorg and execution.  distant #4.
@JustinPulitzer yep agreed.
@cirrusdriver plus he's lost out on a few key small tuck-ins recently that suggest he won't fight higher.
@amishbychoice  I debated it at $31-$32 on FMHT as the bull.  Sort of think its a no brainer there.  Not sure it gets there tho=nice yield.

@RedSquare27 and we bought this week.
@FaceplantJim under $20 v interesting but results should have been btr on execution imo.
@FinMcKool1 under $60 so w/b a big dip
@JWGreen_ thought about selling but 2 new mgmt. teams and cyclical exposure - still cheap.  plus relational wont let them miss 4 long.
@Jackseesall perfect classification.
Sort of amusing that analysts are raising eps numbs for $TKR by 20 cents yet remain hold. Esp into the May s/h mtg and Relational ownership.
@ColinScanlon @BostonCollege A great event as always!
@cirrusdriver @CramersShirt just imagine if I owned it!
@CramersShirt and all the digital focus that Schultz is working on.
@CramersShirt its not this yr that worries me bc they are hedged.  part of next yr isn't.
@Carmelo_Michael thank you!
Wow - can't remember last time $CAT beat on eps/revs and guides up.
$GE rumored to be in discussions to acquire Alstom for $13B.  If true w/b transformational.
@FaceplantJim awhhh - thanks jim.  so nice of you!
@FaceplantJim it will be a 2 only because its still above our basis and limited NT catalysts.
@FaceplantJim @jphymel we buying - note s/b out.
@dcwalsh388 think JCI was mix (later cycle HVAC) vs ETN IR UTX.  we adding to JCI but taking some gains around the others.
@rshamie note coming out - China margins not sustainable (but still expanding). think overall work needs to be done in TB and PH globally.
@JayneKaplan @JWUFL they needed a clean earnings report and it wasn't.  not seeing HVAC lift that others are.  disappointing.  but dn a lot.
@jphymel call @ 11 - adjusting for divest eps in line - auto better, power in line, BE below. wanted better.
@robinstarz absolutely - not doing anything on the name.  still hold LT.
@robinstarz Yes makes me nervous - always preferred low x into Q.
@rshamie no rush on $SWK - quarter likely gives you a chance.
@rshamie we are buying more $BA today... note out shortly (no glitches this time).
@justinwoods83 adjusted for auto electronics removal they beat by a penny.  but w/h liked a cleaner Q.
$EMR 3 mo trail orders accelerate in March: up 5-10% vs 0-5% last 3 months led by huge pick up in process controls and solid network power.
@rshamie no we had system issues.
@TexasAlum only thing I can see is that there is pricing discussions btn the PBMs and bio/pharmas.
@phippsjm GM is down! GE has lagged huge since December.
@phippsjm is he ever?
$IR upgraded to buy at BAC/ML. My blog from last Thursday: http://t.co/ELrD6WiVEr
$UTX beat/raise w/accel organic grth of 5%.Otis orders +11% y/y w/25% organic growth in China.  P&amp;W lrg comm'l spares +11%, UTAS spares +9%.
@HedgeyeHWP and yet the stock reversed and is now higher...
@phippsjm that's what makes a mkt... and we were buying $GE at a variety of levels - not just yesterday.

@spank419 Own/like $FB - Q 2 Q very hard to predict. Interesting u/g 2nite @CSFB &amp
@spank419 I read every tweet and reply almost always.  Unless it's unkind.  So let me know...

@spank419 and thank you!
@LarryBlumen voting shares - GOOGL.  added a bunch of things today.
@musicandwork couldn't agree more - but the ad trends are strong.  we'll see soon enough.
$FB upgraded at CSFB to outperform after the close.  Earlier JMP raised numbers on strong ad trends. $82 target.
@tberla never like to see it but execs sell stock for many reasons -- but they buy for one.  imo.
@aztecs99 @jimcramer will bet you a buck!
@justinwoods83 simply not pleased with the action. LT I like the story, trends. but with 36 names cut losses and will continue to watch.
@gstergio I would expect continued strong operational performance + restructuring benefits.But as we know - its all about macro w/this name.
@gstergio nope 4/30.
@JWUFL we added last week after eps.  sell off overdone + like 2nd half restructuring story.
@JWUFL $JCI $ETN - non res construction data points to show improvement. $FB to post another strong Q of mobile growth. $GM w/strong sales.

@ScottMoudry  have liked the restructuring story &amp
@jeffgent99 seriously?  I tweeted it, wrote about it in AAP, and we own it!
@dcwalsh388 long term I like them both.  short term prob $JCI. would buy either on an eps pullback.

@randadtrade but getting more simple as they reduce fin exposure
@Stockmarket_Kid this one has lagged big time, restructuring the biz towards more industrial v financial, margin upside, Fin IPO.
@J_Cav24 think it will be interesting next Q when they start breaking out CPC by segment. thot did good job on call on mobile growth opp.
@Stockmarket_Kid Oil &amp; Gas, Aviation, Power &amp; Water.  And the bigger place will be margins.  Industrial margins rose 50 bps in Q. Btr v x.
$GE Industrial sales up 8%, profits up 12%, and margins expanded 50 bps.  Been a long time since all three of these were strong.  Solid Q.

@voidoid34 have been a long fan of non res construction.  continue to be. $URI $HTZ $JCI $ETN $IR etc.
@dmrocha1024 we are buying...note out in AAP. very good Q under the surface, imo on revs vs costs which were largely 1x.
@AllanSmall_GTA more EM exposure -- and lack of consistency which I totally get.  depends on the leverage you want.
@AllanSmall_GTA @MMGTrinity We own it - but you asked me to rank them.  I also use TBV not P/E and C is by far cheapest.
@Rodlingo Busy day - 2 eps and an acquisition. Note out now for AAP on $BAC.
@AllanSmall_GTA Im most disappointed in $JPM missed execution. But think he'll be motivated to improve that. Toss up on $C $BAC.
$CSX says last 2 weeks carloads up 11%.  Nice start to 2Q.
@J_Cav24 Expenses better, FICC drag less than peers vs softer GWM.  No big changes to thesis.  We are restricted.

@jeffgent99 thanks - we'll see.  watching closely.  bought some non high flyers today! $GM $COST $XNLX.
@terranovajoe Thanks Joe.  Interesting turn in some of these today.
@kylegolfmtnbike nice!
@Stockmarket_Kid Agree on US. I think Europe auto recovery cycle just beginning.  So pockets there. ECB backstop.  China=a mess.
@Stockmarket_Kid  US recov imo: manufacturing/auto/retail/truck/rail demand &amp
@CNBC_critc @ReformedBroker  I said it was good to have cash - but recommended $ESRX to BUY.  We've been picking all week.
@Stockmarket_Kid admittedly it is a confusing time.  10 yr most surprising to me. but raised some cash and now using it to buy last 2 days.
@Stockmarket_Kid agreed.  picking at stocks slowly.
@OmahaHappyHrs $GM
@CraigScott31 already own $GS small-ish. like the low x into the print.  think $BAC's GWM division will be highlight again.
@CraigScott31 was probably most impressed with $CMA results today vs the others so far.  watching to add $BAC $USB.  torn on $GS.
@JLHose nope nice recovery following last week's disappointing mid term update.
@CraigScott31 never said it was.  but look at the others today:  $FCX $BHP $RIO.  they trade in a group. we paired it back.
@afuntanilla a fave turnaround play for 2014.
@johnestock The stock is up with "old tech" even after a pretty poor Q.  I don't disagree.
Low expectations! RT @musicandwork:  I think Warren, you &amp; I were the only three people who had any confidence in KO this quarter.

@cirrusdriver prolly worth a pick.
$CMA posted 9% sequential growth annualized. Best of the lot so far.

Short holiday week ahead - but watching: China GDP/IP, US IP/retail sales and key EPS: $C $KO $INTC $BAC $IBM $GOOG $GE.
@TexasAlum I think we continue to see more rotation vs correction. US econ OK, eps s/be decent, valuations r fair but btr in certain stocks.
@GCuse1 still like the auto cycle. $GM h/b hard to own (we do) but once they get out of the press I think fundies w/b fine. $F is "cleaner".

@RedSquare27 not really.  we have 17 names that are restricted on so hands are tied.  read the wish list note from yesterday.
@slivingston1968 Great LT story w/solid mgmt.  Just locked in gains. $USB less loved.

@GMSATTY88 i like $ESRX in the low $70s w/secular generic trends in their favor + MHS synergies and low x.  no yield tho so careful picking.
@bradtxxx we in one!
@RedSquare27 don't mind the $YUM trim but I worry about the higher coffee prices/headwinds at $SBUX.  prefer $PNRA $WFM.

@JDR1024 did a blog on it yest.  havent liked the space in a while but starting to warm esp as the weather does + growth initiatives ++eps.
@rahuljaisingh if you can stomach the uneven turnaround - like the new mgmt team, US restructuring but EM will remain a challenge.
@amishbychoice with a $33 target...  it's almost there!
@OracleofWallSt Has been the bear case for a while...
@amishbychoice I lean towards more "under-owned" like $PCP $BEAV even $UTX but I do like that its been a quiet few mos for $BA...

@feru012 funny thought the same.
@nurselindasusan as for your $ESV - we sold it at $60 on the dividend news.  but under $50 this is a high quality mgmt. truly at a + price.
@nurselindasusan no I don't. the rotation is serious and things are changing.  but US economy recovering and playing those that benefit.
@AllanSmall_GTA wouldn't we all! remember tho - double the growth (for now).
@TequilaSunset3 2016 is a long ways off.  but the recovery is happening in the system.  not my favorite at the current level.
@AllanSmall_GTA I get that - but rather this set up into the quarter than at highs.
@JWUFL plenty of them - check our AAP names...
@randadtrade so many others that id rather pick at - but like your strategy.
@RedSquare27 I like your positions. Believe US econ is recovering and the rotation out of spec isn't a bad thing.
@JGN74 we did today...
@DaveMowzer11 will check the system.  do you want to send me your email address?
@JDR1024 yeah I see it too - on what was v good eps imo.  we've been picking all the way down.  but notice $UA cant lift on an u/g.
@scm0330 @CramersShirt interesting bc it used to be China -  but yes, a clear shift.
@JGN74 we added today.
@realemilyclark tough ones - all mo.  but plenty of names that are down in sympathy to add.
@JDR1024 we're doing some picking too - restricted in BAC but I like the p/b too.
@CramersShirt still involved.  quiet is good.
@cirrusdriver good luck!
@JGN74 nothing new on the company specifics - rotation continues.
@ScottStuk its got less beta of the industrials w/solid yield.  under $25 w/be nice level - may get there at this rate.
@CramersShirt over $5 billion in value taken out of it.
Standpoint upgrades $GM to buy intraday.
Oppy upgrades $NFLX and $YELP - de-risking creating a buying opportunity.
Wells Fargo u/g $LII to outperform. A key beneficiary of non resi construction/HVAC demand recovery.  Sees upside to ST/LT targets.
@AllanSmall_GTA well - it works in many instances! time frame is key.
@HelaineWeinberg rotation out of high beta/high valuation stocks that were very overowned into value.
@AllanSmall_GTA yes we own small.  h/b restricted on it for the past week so haven't added but looking to do so ahead of eps.
@boschwitz I still like it - many good things going on there.  Maybe you buy it back if the mkt takes it lower.
@JDR1024 Yes they've spend $2.5 bil of the current $8 bil program.
