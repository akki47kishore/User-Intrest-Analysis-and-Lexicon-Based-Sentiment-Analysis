Emergency was an era of sycophancy suffering from a dichotomy.  A dictatorial regime is often misled by its own propaganda.

The first act after the imposition of the Emergency was the detention of the political opposition under the Preventive Detention Law
Emergency was imposed by Mrs. Indira Gandhi on the midnight of 25-26 June, 1975 because she was unseated by the Allahabad High Court order.

Parties which adopt dynastic succession as an alternative to merit-based leadership creation, suffer from a natural political disadvantage.
Congress' washout from national political scene is a natural outcome of a decade in scandals coupled with its disruptive role in Parliament.
The downfall of the Congress is so evident that even the SP was wondering if it was worth contesting 103 seats in the UP elections.
The squeezing out of the Congress Party. https://t.co/eeE1L7kRtD

The sister has succeeded in robbing the limelight from the brother. Attack Modi was the strategy but ‚Äòdilute Rahul‚Äô is the consequence.
The eclipse of Rahul Gandhi as the defacto PM candidate of Congress is complete. After the mother, now the focus has shifted to the sister.
The desperation with the idea  of a Govt.headed by Modi has resulted in courtesies and rationality slipping out of the Congress‚Äôs campaign.

.@Sunny__Parashar You hold a correct view.
.@sreemoytalukdar Certainly double digit and may be a lot more.

.@s_atrahe Most power projects in India needs coal. We need to clean up the coal block mess created by UPA.
.@zadoosid It is the BJP that has consistently fought for Kashmiri Pundits. Normalcy in the valley and return of KPs is our object.
.@Golumk Join the party, work your way up, excel. You may become a Vajpayee or a Modi irrespective of the family you were born in.
.@p_mulchandani The NDA will have a strong leader who can take action against the corrupt. UPA didn't.

Rubbish claims by AAP. AAP‚Äôs alternative Politics includes a fundamental right to falsehood and lies.
Raking up the communal issue is the last refuge of a desperate UPA  Chairperson faced with adversities of corruption taint &amp
With the new leadership in Congress failing to inspire, Mrs. Gandhi‚Äôs desperation is understandable.
Mrs. Gandhi‚Äôs ‚Äòpoison cultivation‚Äô remark is only intended to communally polarize an election otherwise focused on the development agenda .
Has the UPA which Sonia Gandhi heads subverted India into a kleptocracy?  Is the Government which she controls a filth machine?
Mrs. Sonia Gandhi should  be worried about how her Government is perceived by people in India and outside? Is it a Govt. of gold diggers?
Even Italian middlemen in the VVIP Chopper deal perceived that important decisions in India were being influenced by Mrs.Sonia Gandhi.
Martin Ardbo maintained the diary entries in abbreviation,the infamous ‚ÄúQ‚Äù is known to all. Same practice is followed in the Chopper deal.
The Augusta Westland VVIP chopper deal appears to be a repeat of the Bofors scam-middlemen, diary entries, pay offs &amp; Italian connection.

Delhi Police ACP has stood by law and not meekly followed diktats of his Minister-the only redeeming feature in this unseemly episode.
The action by  AAP cadres to carry out medical tests which included cavity search on some women foreign nationals is contrary to law.
Supreme Court of India has affirmed this principle of Lord Denning in the Vineet Narain case.
Lord Denning further stated that he is not servant to anyone, save of the law itself.  He is answerable to the law and to the law alone.
Lord Denning  held that a police officer is independent of the executive. He is not subject to the orders of the Secretary of State.
A police officer performs functions under law. While exercising his lawful powers, he is certainly not subject to any Ministerial direction.
ACP Shri B.S. Jakhar, who defied the minister but stood by the law has earned our respects. We must all salute ACP Jakhar.
The PM has put up a brave front- that victory in 2014 will be Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs. Will the defeat also be debited to his account? I doubt.
Congress  is nervous- Why risk puncturing its only card in an adverse political environment by declaring Rahul Gandhi as its PM Candidate.
Its the prospect of defeat staring in the face, which is responsible for the reluctance to announce Rahul Gandhi as PM  candidate in 2014.
Obviously Ruling Party MPs elect the PM.But is the concept of a shadow PM or a shadow Minister contrary to democracy.
In 25 years, a Gandhi has not been the PM of this country. India, indeed, is changing. The Gandhis can control a party but not the nation

A dynastic party will sink or swim with the dynasty.
A structured party with a galaxy of leadership and a defined ideology still survives even in adversity.
Strength  of dynastic parties is co-existent &amp
BJP‚Äôs lowest point was in 1984 with  2 seats in LS. We did not lose heart. We did not wait for a day before deciding to fight back.
Privately Ministers refer to the nonpolitical approach of the PMO and the others maintain a position-‚Äúthe boy doesn‚Äôt listen to anybody‚Äù.
The complete collapse  of the Congress to fight back in adversity is astonishing. Resilience  after all is an essential aspect of politics.
The very thought of life after May 2014 is giving jitters to many Congress Ministers. Disillusionment is writ large in their attitude.
Why Congressmen find themselves so demoralized today? Is it because they have been in power for too long and cannot survive without it?

The PM could have changed the Org. Committee of CWG after receiving several reports of its wrong doings but he failed to assert himself.
PM knew that the goal post had been shifted to favour a few in 2G spectrum allocation but lacked the courage to stop &amp
PM‚Äôs failure to assert his authority is writ large in the 2G Scam and the CWG scam.
If in ‚Äò06 &amp; ‚Äò07, the PM as Coal Minister had followed his 2004 decision of the auction route, the coal scam would not have taken place.
AG‚Äôs admission in the SC that the coal block allocation could have been done in a better manner shows the PM failed to assert himself.

Popular sanction for Shri Narendra Modi has been buttressed by the judicial verdict which has accepted his exoneration by SIT.
Modi goes into the 2014 campaign untainted by propaganda.  The verdict has proved that propaganda can never be a substitute for truth.
Congress Party and its sponsored NGOs are unable to fight Narendra Modi politically. They used falsehood in court against him but failed.
Truth has prevailed.  The conspiracy and falsehood to implicate shri Narendra Modi in an offence stands exposed.
Please read my take on the Commission of Inquiry set up by the Central Government :Here is the link: http://t.co/sfNG2yHRTC
Cabinet decision to  appoint a Commission to probe alleged snooping is violative of the Federal structure.
Cabinet appoints a Commission to probe alleged snooping- it is legally a suspect and will be challenged in court.

Is AAP using the Congress to form a government or is congress using AAP to delay a fresh poll?
The Congress wants to delay a re-poll in Delhi beyond the Lok Sabha poll.
The AAP Government will last only as long as the congress wants it to last.
The congress will face a daily humiliation and yet support AAP  since it can‚Äôt afford another an early election in Delhi.
Please read my article "The Congress-AAP Paradox": Here is the link: http://t.co/r0RWMsfdbQ
Please read my Article "Thoughts on Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests". Here is the link:  http://t.co/RmRY3ypQXS
Is this the beginning of AAP‚Äôs alternative politics or the end of it.
Did not realize that AAP‚Äôs alternative politics included a search for alternative options.
When individuals change positions it is called a defection.   When AAP does the same it is bowing to the will of the people.
Political opportunism to form Government in Delhi being masked with the ‚ÄòWill of the People‚Äô desiring it.
Please read my article "Political Opportunism camouflaged with popular sanction. Here is the link:http://t.co/zuNNMx7lLy
Arrogance in politics is always counterproductive. Those you  meet on your way up would also be there to meet you when you are coming down.
PMs are not judged by the  number of years they spend in office but by the direction which they gave to the economy and the polity.
India can not afford a non-politician as a PM. Prime Ministership  is not an employment.
Despite inadequate governance, we had 8 to 9 % growth rates. What would be India‚Äôs potential with effective governance is anybody's guess
There can be no alibi for non-performance on the economic front. Governments which fail to deliver on the economy tend to look for alibis.

Guided by the Mantra of ‚ÄòReform, Perform &amp; Transform‚Äô we are determined to further improve our rankings &amp; scale greater economic growth.
It has never been easier to do business in India. India welcomes the world to explore economic opportunities our nation has to offer!
Over the last 3 years we have seen a spirit of positive competition among states towards making business easier. This has been beneficial.
Easier business environment is leading to historic opportunities for our entrepreneurs, particularly MSME sector &amp; bringing more prosperity.
Historic jump in ‚ÄòEase of Doing Business‚Äô rankings is the outcome of the all-round &amp
I congratulate everyone who took part in ‚ÄòRun for Unity.' It is gladdening to see the initiative get such widespread support across India.

This National Voter Registration Day let's recommit to dismantling barriers to the ballot box and get #VoteReady! -Rep. John Lewis
In order to ensure America‚Äôs government reflects our values, each and every one of us must play a role in shaping it. -Rep. John Lewis
And we too cannot stand by. We must stand up, speak up, and speak out for what's right. We all must register to vote. -Rep. John Lewis
The courage of the young people in the Civil Rights Movement was not divine or innate. They made a choice to take action. -Rep. John Lewis
I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Alabama for the right to vote. -Rep. John Lewis
Never forget that those who marched from Selma to Montgomery were just ordinary people with an extraordinary vision. -Rep. John Lewis
Many were harassed, jailed, beaten, and some were even killed for trying to participate in the democratic process. -Rep. John Lewis
Before the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it was almost impossible for some citizens to register and vote. -Rep. John Lewis
We‚Äôre too quiet. There's too much at stake. No one can afford to stay silent or stay on the side-lines. -Rep. John Lewis
The right to vote ‚Äì a right that many people bled for and died to secure ‚Äì is under attack in America. -Rep. John Lewis
The Democratic Party believes our country is stronger when more people can participate in our elections, not fewer. -Rep. John Lewis
The right to vote is precious and almost sacred. It‚Äôs the most powerful, nonviolent tool or instrument in our democracy. -Rep. John Lewis
