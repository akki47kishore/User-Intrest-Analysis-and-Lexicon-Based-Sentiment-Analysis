"Full-time: Arsenal 2-2 Chelsea.
What a contest! A frantic finish but in the end the points are shared. #ARSCHE https://t.co/GCYjjVY5j9"
Oh my word! We nearly go back in front again, first Cech saves from Morata and then Zappacosta rattles the crossbar. So close. #ARSCHE
Arsenal goal: Hector Bellerin levels with two minutes left. Ball falls loose and he finds the far corner. 2-2. #ARSCHE
Four minutes of added time. #ARSCHE
Offside against Walcott. Opportunity for a little respite. We're in the final minute of the 90. #ARSCHE
Courtois punches the corner clear. It's back in but we get it away again. A long few minutes ahead... #ARSCHE
Just over three minutes to go and Arsenal have a corner. They're bringing on Theo Walcott for Calum Chambers. #ARSCHE
He's done it again! 🙌 @marcosalonso03 #ARSCHE https://t.co/LTxLN43wIt

CHELSEA PENALTY! #ARSCHE
1-0. 25 minutes left. Come on you Blues... #ARSCHE
Lacazette almost doubles the lead as Arsenal pour forward but Courtois turns it around the post. Great save again. #ARSCHE
The ball took a bounce off Zappacosta and fell kindly for the Arsenal man. No chance for Courtois. #ARSCHE
Arsenal goal: Jack Wilshere smashes in off the post after the ball bounces free inside the box. 1-0 to the hosts. 62 minutes played. #ARSCHE
This time it's Gary Cahill who covers after Ozil breaks through the Chelsea defence. Sanchez had a tap-in otherwise. #ARSCHE
Another big save from the big man! 🚫 #ARSCHE https://t.co/znBjkmFzTg
Azplicueta stretches to deny an Arsenal chance inside the six-yard box. More good defending from the Spaniard. #ARSCHE
Mustafi fouls Hazard. He protests, not really sure why. #ARSCHE
Victor Moses makes way for Zappacosta. He had been struggling with a knock in the first half. 55 minutes gone. #ARSCHE
Arsenal have a corner so Chelsea will wait for the change. We clear and now it's time for the sub. #ARSCHE
Davide Zappacosta is waiting to come on for Chelsea. He's been on the touchline for a couple of minutes now as play goes on. #ARSCHE

Unbelievable stop. #ARSCHE https://t.co/yNpnzEWAQG
Another Hazard shot is blocked. Good period for the Blues. #ARSCHE

From Willian's free-kick, Bakayoko heads wide. 40 minutes played, still Huddersfield 0 Chelsea 1. #HUDCHE
The mercurial Hazard has too much strength, speed and skill for the Terriers and he is brought down wide on the right. #HUDCHE
Willian's inswinger is cleared only as far as Kante on the edge of the box. The Frenchman fires over. 37 minutes played. #HUDCHE
Willian's delivery is headed away but a foul on Alonso gives us a free-kick in a good spot. #HUDCHE

After a brief spell of Huddersfield possession, the Blues are back on the ball and Pedro has won us a corner. #HUDCHE
Chelsea remain on the front foot since opening the scoring. We're nearing the half-hour mark at the John Smith's Stadium. #HUDCHE
It's a wonderful finish from Bakayoko, who clipped his shot over Lossl after Willian had calmly slipped him in. 1-0 Chelsea! #HUDCHE
BAKAYOKO STRIKES! #HUDCHE https://t.co/Zaw3pHINzq
Christensen heads the first corner of the game from Mooy away, and when the ball is played back in, the offside flag is raised. #HUDCHE
Fifteen minutes played in Huddersfield and it's been mostly Chelsea with the ball. No clear sights of goal yet, though. #HUDCHE
Lossl steps up to punch Moses's cross out of the box and Kante can't quite get on the end of the loose ball. #HUDCHE
A fine low Alonso cross is allowed to travel far in the box before Mooy stabs it out for a throw-in. #HUDCHE
Azpilicueta blocks an ambitious Mooy volley to end Huddersfield's first attack of the game. Goalless with 10 minutes played. #HUDCHE
Pedro has the ball in the net but the offside flag is up so the goal won't stand. #HUDCHE
A pass over the top from Azpilicueta is very nearly brought under control by Hazard but the ball skips away from him. #HUDCHE
A quiet start to proceedings here at the John Smith's Stadium, with most of the play taking place in the middle third so far. #HUDCHE

Great save! Kante's curler looked to be heading into the far corner but Adrian made the save. #WHUCHE
Great defending by Christensen who got back at Arnautovic, who had initially beaten him, to make a crucial block. #WHUCHE

Donald Guerrier has a rare effort for the home side from range which Courtois easily catches. #QARCHE
Fabregas releases Morata with another clever pass and this time Sehic stands tall to deny the Spaniard. #QARCHE
Final Chelsea change: Drinkwater is on for Kante with 15 minutes to go. #QARCHE

Its another penalty to Chelsea! #QARCHE
Morata has the ball in the net but the offside flag was up against Azpilicueta so we are denied a third. 70 minutes played. #QARCHE
Morata puts a presentable chance wide as a patient Chelsea attack ended with Rudiger picking out the Spaniard in space. #QARCHE
Pedro puts Morata away and a fine sliding tackle from Guerrier clears the ball before he can shoot. #QARCHE
Outstanding save from Sehic denies Hazard a goal after Kante had cutely slipped in the Belgian. That will be Hazard… https://t.co/yd5Hu1KUkS
It looks like Alvaro Morata will be on shortly. #QARCHE
In the wake of this sub, Azpilicueta has shifted to left wing-back and Cahill is on the left of defence. #QARCHE
First Chelsea change of the evening on 57 minutes: Marcos Alonso is replaced by Gary Cahill. #QARCHE

Azpilicueta floats a now trademark cross in from the right, Hazard is there to meet it and he heads straight at Sehic. #QARCHE
30 mins played here. It's Qarabag 0-1 Chelsea. #QARCHE https://t.co/svxx5KT6ci
This is the third straight Champions League match Qarabag have had a man sent off. They are currently set up in a 4-4-1 formation. #QARCHE
The 900 or so travelling Chelsea supporters are in great voice high up behind the goal we are defending. #QARCHE
Hazard sends Sehic the wrong way from the spot! Midway through the half and we have a goal and a man advantage. Come on Chelsea! #QARCHE

David Luiz rises to meet an inswinging Fabregas corner and his header loops up and wide of the target. 12 minutes played. #QARCHE
Now the Spaniard blocks a shot after miscommunication between Zappacosta and Fabregas. 9 minutes played. #QARCHE
Azpilicueta dashes across and executes a perfect sliding tackle which puts a halt to a Qarabag counter. #QARCHE

The final Chelsea substitution on 83 minutes is Jon Panzo on for Marc Guehi. #CFCU19
A bad challenge by Mehdiyev on St Clair as the Chelsea winger crosses the ball rightly earns a yellow card. #CFCU19
The Blues go close again through Maddox. This has been a good response after going behind as the wind continues to gust around. #CFCU19
Qarabag only half-clear danger and McEachran makes them pay with a tidy finish on 77 minutes.  #CFCU19

Taylor-Crossdale on the attack again cuts inside a defender and has a low shot saved. #CFCU19
Booking for Gallagher for a foul midway inside our half. 62 minutes played. #CFCU19
Taylor Crossdale, who was the man fouled, makes it 1-1. #CFCU19 https://t.co/yoCBOJ6uFV
PENALTY TO CHELSEA! #CFCU19
Conor Gallagher is introduced in place of Tariq Uwakwe on 55 minutes with his side trailing by the only goal. #CFCU19
Taylor-Crossdale has a shot on target but too close to the keeper. #CFCU19
Chelsea try to mount an instant response but Maddox's attempted centre to Taylor-Crossdale is cut out.  #CFCU19
GOAL: Qarabag 1 Chelsea 0. This time Deda does find the target as he shoots through Bulka's legs. #CFCU19
The first chance of the second half falls to Qarabag but fortunately Deda hammers his shot over the bar. #CFCU19
