I hope India’s success at #GC2018 motivates more youngsters to pursue sports and creates larger awareness on the importance of fitness in everyone’s lives. 

On our part, we in the Government are doing everything possible to strengthen the #FitIndia movement.
Every athlete who represented India at #GC2018 inspires us. Their life stories illustrate the power of dedication and a never-say-die attitude that made them overcome countless hurdles to attain the heights of success they did at the CWG.
India's contingent at the 2018 Commonwealth Games has made every Indian extremely proud. All our sportspersons gave their best and played very well. I congratulate all those athletes who are bringing back medals. #GC2018

सबका साथ, सबका विकास के मंत्र के साथ हम बाबासाहेब की दिखाई राह पर चलते रहेंगे। https://t.co/mdCnPvQVwg
पूज्य बाबासाहेब के महापरिनिर्वाण के बाद कांग्रेस ने राष्ट्र निर्माण में उनके योगदान को भी मिटाने की कोशिश की।

भाजपा के प्रयासों के कारण उनकी तस्वीर सेंट्रल हॉल में लगाई गई, उन्हें भारत रत्न से सम्मानित किया गया। https://t.co/9kCuBQbm2k
एक नहीं, दो बार कांग्रेस ने पूज्य बाबासाहेब को चुनाव में हराया।

उस समय अगर कोई पूज्य बाबासाहेब के साथ डटकर खड़े रहे तो वे थे डॉ. श्यामा प्रसाद मुखर्जी और जनसंघ। https://t.co/sjxXBWkGVb
आज भी कांग्रेस नहीं बदली। वो बाबासाहेब को अपमानित करती रहती है।

ओबीसी कमीशन के मामले में कांग्रेस का नकारात्मक रुख सब जानते हैं। https://t.co/U2Fzd4IaDU
आज के युवाओं को जानना आवश्यक है कि किस तरह कांग्रेस ने पूज्य बाबासाहेब को हर समय अपमानित किया! https://t.co/ZeIR6SsntW

पूज्य बाबासाहेब के विचारों का मूल तत्व है - समानता।  हमारी सरकार की प्रत्येक योजना में सामाजिक न्याय और बिना किसी भेदभाव के सभी को समानता का अधिकार देने का प्रयास दिखेगा। https://t.co/OEWTZydZeq
हमारी सरकार का बड़ा सौभाग्य रहा है कि हमें पूज्य बाबासाहेब से जुड़े हुए 5 स्थानों को पंचतीर्थ के रूप में विकसित करने का अवसर मिला। ये स्थान, ये तीर्थ सिर्फ ईंट-गारे की इमारत भर नहीं हैं, बल्कि ये जीवंत संस्थाएं हैं, प्रेरणा के स्रोत हैं। https://t.co/MSZ3bxp08M

PSEs have to be New India Ratnas, for which they have to focus on performance, processes, persona, procurement and preparation. https://t.co/0Y5BWqA0GH
Be it the public sector or private sector, what builds successful enterprises are Incentives, Imagination &amp; Institution Building. https://t.co/V1AHt0CxKQ
PSEs are social benefit generating enterprises. Many of the staff members associated with PSEs work in distant locations, in the midst of several adversities. https://t.co/MaxLJcVL8p

Dear friends on social media, do share with me success stories of Mudra Yojana that you know about. I would love to meet some of the friends from the world of social media who share these stories!
On 11th April, I look forward to a special programme! I will be interacting with beneficiaries of the Mudra Yojana at my residence. It would be wonderful to speak to them and personally hear about their journeys.
Through Mudra Yojana, the MSME sector is receiving a substantial impetus. MSME is a sector that is crucial for India’s transformation and our Government is undertaking a series of steps and reforms to facilitate further growth in the sector.
The Mudra Yojana is furthering a spirit of enterprise and self-reliance among the youth and women of India. A substantial number of Mudra beneficiaries are women and youngsters from the SC, ST and OBC communities, which is extremely heartening.
On this day, three years ago the Mudra Yojana was launched to give wings to the aspirations of our citizens and harness the entrepreneurial energy among our youth. Three years on, I am delighted to see how Mudra Yojana has brought prosperity in the lives of many.

The energy and enthusiasm of our Karyakartas makes me happy. I also admire their passion to serve people and contribute to India’s transformation.
The speciality of the BJP is that our Karyakartas are our family. Yesterday, we sat together as Karyakartas and discussed diverse issues regarding the nation as well as our party.

बिहार के मेहनतकश कार्यकर्ताओं से बातचीत में एक महत्वपूर्ण बिन्दु निकलकर आया कि क्यों आज हमारे कार्यकर्ताओं को नियमित रूप से घर-घर जाकर लोगों को पिछले चार साल में हुए कार्यों के बारे में न केवल बताना है, बल्कि उन्हें अलग-अलग जन-कल्याणकारी योजनाओं से भी जोड़ना है। https://t.co/IMTKK7ltA1

हिमाचल से प्रवीण शर्मा जी जानना चाह रहे थे कि 3-4 दशक पहले जब मैं  बीजेपी में आया तब बीजेपी का कार्यकर्ता होना और आज बीजेपी का कार्यकर्ता होने में क्या फर्क है? मज़ेदार बात यह थी कि मैंने प्रवीण जी की आवाज़ सुनते ही पहचान लिया था कि ये वही बड़ी-बड़ी मूँछों वाले प्रवीण जी हैं। https://t.co/yHwFYMjr9o
One of the most satisfying parts of my programme with @BJP4India Karyakartas was the opportunity to connect and interact with them. They had some very interesting subjects to talk about.

Some say our aim to eliminate TB by 2025 is over-ambitious. 

Yes, it is not an easy aim but the way we have transformed the working of the Government over the last 4 years, I am convinced that we will achieve it. Our holistic approach is bringing transformative results. https://t.co/EQ2wmtsRu5
All over the world, 2030 has been decided as the year by which TB must be eliminated. We in India are working towards eliminating TB by 2025! https://t.co/DJEnWeFS9Y
Its been years since @WHO declared TB as an emergency. Various countries have done a lot to end TB but the disease is not fully eliminated. This means we need a fresh approach, which the 'Delhi End-TB Summit' provides. https://t.co/3GhrzDUnYM

While we are naturally delighted about the historic victory in Tripura, we will always have in our thoughts and prayers the BJP Karyakartas who lost their lives due to mindless Communist violence. It is due to their courage that the party has reached where it has today.
Addressed @BJP4India Karyakartas at the Party Office this evening. We are are extremely proud of the party’s performance in the Northeast. Here is my speech on the occasion. https://t.co/8RyrN8dSkz
Time and again, election after election, the people of India are reposing their faith in the positive and development oriented agenda of the NDA. People do not have the time or respect for negative, disruptive and disconnected politics of any kind.
Thank you Nagaland for supporting @BJP4Nagaland and our valued ally. I assure my sisters and brothers of Nagaland that we will continue to work for the progress and prosperity of Nagaland. I applaud the tireless work of the local BJP unit.
I express my gratitude to the people of Meghalaya for supporting @BJP4Meghalaya. The welfare of Meghalaya is of utmost importance for us. I appreciate the BJP Karyakartas for their continued efforts in the state to serve the people.
The historic victory in Tripura is as much an ideological one. It is a win for democracy over brute force and intimidation. Today peace and non-violence has prevailed over fear. We will provide Tripura the good government that the state deserves.
The victory of @BJP4Tripura is not an ordinary electoral victory. This journey from ‘Shunya’ to ‘Shikhar’ has been made possible due to a solid development agenda and the strength of our organisation. I bow to every BJP Karyakarta for working assiduously on the ground for years.
2018 Tripura election will be remembered as an epoch-making one! What my sisters and brothers of Tripura have done is extraordinary. No words will be enough to thank them for the phenomenal support towards @BJP4Tripura. We will leave no stone unturned in transforming Tripura.
People of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura have spoken! 

I thank the people of these states for supporting the good governance agenda and ‘Act East Policy’ of @BJP4India &amp; our valued allies. We remain committed to working towards fulfilling the dreams &amp; aspirations of the people.

Today Davanagere spoke in one clear voice. 

The anti-farmer Congress Government in Karnataka has to go. People want change and people want @BJP4Karnataka! https://t.co/JbVuNmdcEv
They ruled India for 48 years, treated the nation like a family fiefdom and only cared about their own interests.

We have served for almost 48 months and have devoted our energies and every moment of our time for the welfare of 125 crore Indians. https://t.co/ivzrNEphRf https://t.co/VTuGRfKWoS
Seeing politics everywhere, Karnataka’s Congress Government fails to spend resources for the state’s growth. https://t.co/fldf1jxTAE

Karnataka deserves an honest and people-friendly Government, which only @BJP4Karnataka can provide. https://t.co/4LLUccRU9Z
The NDA Government had the honour to introduce the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana that is the most farmer-friendly crop insurance scheme India has seen. https://t.co/Ol1Wdw5CC4

Guided by the rich ideals of Guru Ravidas Ji, we are working round the clock to build an India which is strong, inclusive and prosperous…where the fruits of development reach everybody and empower those who are poor. https://t.co/DpuU90z1S6
Today I would like to share these words of Guru Ravidas Ji:

ऐसा चाहूँ राज मैं जहाँ मिलै सबन को अन्न।
छोट बड़ो सब सम बसै, रैदास रहै प्रसन्न।।

Guru Ravidas Ji dreamt of a time when everybody has enough to eat and every person is happy.
Guru Ravidas Ji had unwavering faith in values of harmony and brotherhood. He did not believe in any kind of discrimination. When we work with the motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ we are deeply motivated by Guru Ravidas Ji’s emphasis on serving every human, especially the poor
Guru Ravidas Ji ushered in several positive changes in our society. He questioned practices that were archaic and regressive, and inspired people to change with the times. This spirit of inquiry and emphasis on moving with the times makes extremely great.
I bow to Guru Ravidas Ji on his Jayanti. Guru Ravidas Ji was one of the greatest Saints to have been born in our land. He stood for a society that is equal, just and compassionate. His teachings are eternal and are relevant for people of all sections of society. https://t.co/vJa2GmojpY

In Shillong I will inaugurate the Shillong-Nongstoin-Rongjeng-Tura Road. This project will improve connectivity and further economic growth. I will also address a public meeting.
Giving wings to our Yuva Shakti, DoNER has set up a Rs. 100 crore Northeast Venture Capital Fund. Tomorrow I will be distributing cheques to entrepreneurs from this fund. A spirit of enterprise among the Northeast’s youth augurs well for the empowerment of the region.
It is my privilege to be dedicating the Tuirial Hydropower Project to the nation at tomorrow’s programme in Aizawl. The completion of this project is a boon for the people of Mizoram.

I am devoting my life for the betterment of crores of people of Gujarat and India. Have been fortunate to always get your blessings. I am sure you will continue to bless us in these elections too by voting for BJP.
No Gujarati will let go off a golden opportunity of development of our youth and coming generations. Victory of BJP is a guarantee for a bright future.
With the Government of India and Government of Gujarat working together, the strength rises manifold. This 1+ 1 is not 2 but 11 and together we will take Gujarat to new heights.
The lies that our worthy opponents have spread, about Gujarat, Gujarat’s growth and about me personally is something I had never imagined. It is natural for every Gujarati to feel hurt. People of Gujarat will give a fitting reply to the negativity and lies of the opposition.
I urge my sisters and brothers of Gujarat to vote in record numbers on the 14th. I call upon the people of Gujarat to not only give the BJP an overwhelming majority but also ensure that BJP wins in every polling booth across the state.
During my travels across Gujarat, the level of affection I have received from the people is unparalleled in my 40 years of public life. This affection gives me strength and motivates me to devote all my time for India’s development.
Campaigning for the Gujarat Assembly Elections 2017 ends. After three and a half years, I got the honour to travel across the length and breadth of Gujarat to seek the blessings of the people.
ગુજરાતનું, દેશનું અને કરોડો નાગરિકોનું કઈંક સારું કરવાની નેમથી જિંદગી ખપાવી રહ્યો છું, આપના આશીર્વાદ સદાયે મળતા રહ્યા છે.આ ચૂંટણીમાં પણ કમળ પર બટન દબાવી આશીર્વાદ આપશો એ જ નમ્ર વિનંતી.
વિકાસનો, આપણી યુવા પેઢીનો અને આવનારી પેઢીઓનો આ સુવર્ણ અવસર કોઈ ગુજરાતી જતો નહિ કરે. ભાજપનો વિજય ઉજ્જવળ ભવિષ્યની ગેરંટી છે.
ભારત સરકાર અને ગુજરાત સરકાર ખભેખભો મિલાવીને કામ કરે તો શક્તિ ૧+૧ = ૨ નહિ પરંતુ ૧ની બાજુમાં ૧ =  ૧૧ ની તાકાત મળે અને ગુજરાતનો વિકાસ તેટલી ઝડપે આગળ વધે.
ગુજરાત ઉપર ગુજરાતના ઉદ્યમી અને મહેનતકશ નાગરિકો માટે તેમજ વ્યક્તિગત રીતે મારા માટે પણ ન કલ્પી શકાય એવી વાતો વિરોધીઓએ કહી. સહુ ગુજરાતીઓની લાગણી ઘવાય, ચોટ લાગે એ સ્વાભાવિક છે. આ માટેનો જવાબ ૧૪ તારીખે વોટથી આપવો એ ઉત્તમ માર્ગ છે.
૧૪મી તારીખે પણ પ્રથમ તબક્કાની જેમ ભાજપ તરફી વધુમાં વધુ મતદાન કરી એક એક પોલીંગ બુથમાં ભાજપ અને કમળને વિજયી બનવવાના આપના સંકલ્પને મેં બરાબર અનુભવ્યો છે.
મારા જાહેર જીવનના 40 વર્ષમાં મેં ક્યારેય ન અનુભવી હોય એવી લાગણી અને પ્રેમ આપે આપ્યો. સગા દીકરાને વધાવે એમ આપે મને વધાવ્યો. આપનો પ્રેમ, આપના આશીર્વાદ મને શક્તિ આપે છે, કરોડો ભારતવાસીઓ માટે જીવન ખપાવવાની ઉર્જા આપે છે, આપનો હું સદૈવ ઋણી છું.
ટૂંક સમયમાં ગુજરાત વિધાનસભા ચૂંટણીના પ્રચાર પડઘમ બંધ થશે. લગભગ સાડા ત્રણ વર્ષ પછી ગુજરાતના અલગ અલગ જિલ્લામાં જઈને જનતા જનાર્દનના દર્શન કરવાનો અને તેમના આશીર્વાદ લેવાનું સૌભાગ્ય મળ્યું.
Sea plane services can also be helpful during times of medical emergencies. Those needing even quicker access to medical care and those living in remote areas stand to gain a lot.
Effective use of waterways augurs well for tourism.

I pray that those injured in the bus accident in J&amp;K recover soon.
Extremely pained by the loss of lives of Amarnath Yatris due to a bus accident in J&amp;K. My thoughts are with the families of the deceased.
सभी दलों ने इस चुनाव की गरिमा का ध्यान रखा। यह हमारे लोकतंत्र की परिपक्वता की ऊँचाई है।अब हमें सुनिश्चित करना है कि एक भी वोट बेकार न जाए।
इस बार के राष्ट्रपति चुनाव ऐतिहासिक हैं। संभवत: पहली बार किसी भी दल ने दूसरे उम्मीदवार पर अमर्यादित टिप्पणी या बेवजह बयानबाजी नहीं की।
ये अवसर युवा पीढ़ी को अगस्त क्रांति का महत्व बताने का है। मेरा अनुरोध है कि दोनों सदनों व देश भर में इस अवसर पर कार्यक्रमों का आयोजन हो।
9 अगस्त को अगस्त क्रांति के 75 वर्ष पूरे हो रहे हैं। यह अवसर देश की स्वतंत्रता के लिए अपना जीवन खपा देने वाले महान सपूतों को याद करने का है।
देश को लूटनेवालों के खिलाफ जब कानून अपना काम करता है तो सियासी साजिश की बात करके बचने का रास्ता खोजने वालों के विरुद्ध एकजुट होना होगा
सार्वजनिक जीवन में स्वच्छता के साथ ही भ्रष्ट नेताओं पर कार्रवाई आवश्यक है। हर दल ऐसे नेताओं को पहचानकर अपने दल की राजनीतिक यात्रा से अलग करे
कई दशकों से नेताओं की साख हमारे बीच के ही कुछ नेताओं के बर्ताव की वजह से कठघरे में है।हमें जनता को भरोसा दिलाना होगा कि हर नेता दागी नहीं है
हम सभी राजनीतिक दलों को गौरक्षा के नाम पर हो रही इस गुंडागर्दी की कड़ी भर्त्सना करनी चाहिए।
राज्य सरकारों को ये भी देखना चाहिए कि कहीं कुछ लोग गौरक्षा के नाम पर अपनी व्यक्तिगत दुश्मनी का बदला तो नहीं ले रहे हैं।
कानून व्यवस्था को बनाए रखना राज्य सरकार की जिम्मेदारी है और जहां भी ऐसी घटनाएं हो रही हैं, राज्य सरकारों को इनसे सख्ती से निपटना चाहिए।
गाय को हमारे यहां माँ मानते हैं,लोगों की भावनाएं जुड़ी हैं। लेकिन यह समझना होगा कि गौ रक्षा के लिए कानून हैं और इन्हें तोड़ना विकल्प नहीं है
देश की छवि पर भी इसका असर पड़ रहा है। राज्य सरकारों को ऐसे असामाजिक तत्वों पर कठोर कार्रवाई करनी चाहिए।
गौरक्षा को कुछ असामाजिक तत्वों ने अराजकता फैलाने का माध्यम बना लिया है। इसका फायदा देश में सौहार्द बिगाड़ने में लगे लोग भी उठा रहे हैं।
देश के कई हिस्सों में और विशेषकर उत्तर पूर्व के राज्यों में बाढ़ की वजह से उत्पन्न हालात पर केंद्र सरकार राज्यों के संपर्क में है।
इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर से जुड़े परियोजनाओं में इस बार Capital expenditure पिछले साल के मुकाबले 49 प्रतिशत बढ़ा है।
पिछले बजट सत्र को एक महीने पहले करने के अच्छे परिणाम आये हैं। CAG के अनुसार पिछले साल अप्रैल जून के मुकाबले इस बार 30% ज्यादा राशि खर्च हुई
जीएसटी लागू हुए 15 दिन से ज्यादा हो रहे हैं और इन 15 दिनों में ही कई सकारात्मक परिणाम दिखाई देने लगे हैं।
जीएसटी के समय जिस तरह से सभी राजनीतिक दल एक साथ आए, इसके  लिए सभी दल धन्यवाद के पात्र  हैं।
मुझे उम्मीद है कि मॉनसून सत्र में भी समय, संसाधन और सदन की मर्यादा का ध्यान रखते हुए सार्थक विचार-मंथन होंगे।
मॉनसून सत्र के पहले सर्वदलीय बैठक में भाग लिया। कुछ अपवादों को छोड़ दें तो गत 3 वर्षों में हर सत्र में Productivity में बढ़ोतरी हुई है। https://t.co/FwgAgjcTy7

I have also asked my colleague @KirenRijiju to personally supervise the rescue, relief operations &amp; facilitate all possible help needed.
I have spoken to Arunachal Pradesh CM @PemaKhanduBJP &amp; other officials both in Delhi &amp; the states on the flood situation.
The entire nation stands with the people of Northeast during this time. Centre assures all possible help to normalise the situation.
I am anguished by the situation arising due to floods in various parts of the Northeast. I share the pain of all those affected by floods.
I have spoken to the Governor and Chief Minister of J&amp;K and assured all possible assistance required.
India will never get bogged down by such cowardly attacks &amp; the evil designs of hate.
My thoughts are with all those who lost their loved ones in the attack in J&amp;K. My prayers with the injured.
Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath Yatris in J&amp;K. The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone.
I remember an insightful discussion with Naresh Ji, who as USA ambassador invited me for dinner. He believed in strong India-USA friendship.
Shri Naresh Chandra was an outstanding public servant, who left an indelible mark on matters of governance &amp; policy. Pained by his demise.
Wishing my valued colleague, a grounded personality &amp; wonderful leader, Shri @rajnathsingh Ji on his birthday. I pray for his long life.
A matter of immense joy for India! https://t.co/qtCOxm8Kga
