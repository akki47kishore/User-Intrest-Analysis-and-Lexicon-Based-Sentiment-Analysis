My last tweet on this subject:  post-GFC economy has been constrained by factors beyond scope of monetary policy and Fed’s policies may have caused financial distortions &amp; unintended (or unkown) consequences (echoing Peter Fisher’s thinking)
@ModeledBehavior Perhaps, but every side being debated is a counter-factual ... we will never know whether the economy would be better or worse if the Fed (or politicians, or business leaders) had done something different ... I like to think in shades of gray, not black-and-white
@mark_dow @pdacosta @D_Blanchflower I think it was perhaps a psychological negative and there were diminishing returns to consider as well as unintended consequences- like forcing investors out the risk spectrum and asset inflation (all of which the Fed has conceded many times) ... that’s all I’ve been positing

@pdacosta @D_Blanchflower How did ZIRP and a $4.5t balance sheet do in terms of boosting growth?  All that said, speculating on what would’ve been is simply counter factual analysis.
@pdacosta @D_Blanchflower I guess I would just posit that the Fed keeping rates so low for so long (treating the economic patient like it was perpetually in the ER) actually contributed to what has been the weakest recovery/expansion (including wages) in history

Hello Tweeps- on vacation next week so I WILL BE ON TWITTER LESS- celebrating many milestones this year: our daughter's 18th, my mom's 80th, my parents' 60th, my dad's 88th, my hubby's 55th, our 25th, our daughter becoming a Clemson Tiger
No buying “thrust” during the 6-day rally ... closest we got was an 83% up volume ratio—shy of the 90% thrust threshold (not a significant factor preventing further gains historically according to @sentimentrader)
