My last tweet on this subject:  post-GFC economy has been constrained by factors beyond scope of monetary policy and Fed’s policies may have caused financial distortions &amp; unintended (or unkown) consequences (echoing Peter Fisher’s thinking)
@ModeledBehavior Perhaps, but every side being debated is a counter-factual ... we will never know whether the economy would be better or worse if the Fed (or politicians, or business leaders) had done something different ... I like to think in shades of gray, not black-and-white
@mark_dow @pdacosta @D_Blanchflower I think it was perhaps a psychological negative and there were diminishing returns to consider as well as unintended consequences- like forcing investors out the risk spectrum and asset inflation (all of which the Fed has conceded many times) ... that’s all I’ve been positing

Andrew McCabe is the now-fired Deputy Director of the FBI whose wife took $500k+ in campaign contributions from Clinton allies and recused himself from the Clinton investigation only a week before 2016's election. The FBI is stonewalling JW on his texts.

With the release of Democrat &amp; GOP Memos, it's clear that the American people deserve to see the facts themselves. JW filed a FOIA lawsuit w/ DOJ to release the FISA applications, the FISA warrants, &amp; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decisions. https://t.co/1iwlCOQZDQ
JW filed a FOIA lawsuit w/ DOJ for FBI docs on Comey’s forthcoming memoir — FBI officials are typically required to submit transcripts for pre-publication review. JW wants to see if Comey got special treatment like he did when he leaked info to the media. https://t.co/NWXvppCjHa
Important: Again showing how the federal government hides information from the American public, new Department of Justice emails obtained by Judicial Watch reveal that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch used an alias to conduct official DOJ business. https://t.co/jzU9g8qQiF
Following the now-infamous Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting, docs obtained by JW show the FBI leadership worked to cover it up. Emails show the FBI leaders seemed concerned not about the meeting itself, but instead about the whistleblower who got the word out. https://t.co/3lCLr40ce1
Because of JW's efforts holding the Mueller investigation accountable, JW found info showing bias in top DOJ officials like Andrew Weissmann — a key prosecutor on Mueller’s team — praising Obama holdover Sally Yates for lawlessly thwarting President Trump.

JW Prez @TomFitton: The Supreme Court would be on a dangerous course if it endorses lower courts on gerrymandering. SCOTUS should pick a reasonable judicial standard for evaluating gerrymanders, so voters pick politicians – not the other way around. (7/7)
https://t.co/p2fOawfafj
JW Prez @TomFitton: The lower courts in Maryland would tell the Supreme Court to ignore the most abusive gerrymander in the country, while the lower courts in Wisconsin would have the courts overturn district lines if not enough Democrats win. (6/7)
https://t.co/p2fOawfafj
Similarly, in August of 2017, Judicial Watch &amp; AEF also filed an amici brief in the Wisconsin gerrymandering case urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject the arbitrary method of drawing Wisconsin’s electoral districts adopted by the lower court. (5/7)

Judicial Watch &amp; AEF argue that the test applied by the lower court in this case was inadequate to determine whether Maryland’s redistricting scheme constitutes an unconstitutional &amp; partisan gerrymander that violates the First Amendment. (3/7)
