For every #cryptocurrency investor out there, here are my 3 Rich Dad Fundamentals: https://t.co/irlpTXatFx https://t.co/Yub3v5TAiX
Stupidity is believing you already have all the answers. #richdad #financialeducation
It's not about having all the answers before you start.   It's about discovering the right questions along the way. #richdad
I do not need you to agree with me. I just need you to understand that there's a different way to think about money and finance. #richdad

#richdad https://t.co/XFLH4SE7ir
Don't allow a disappointment to make you say, "I'll never do that again." Making one attempt isn't enough. #richdad
Successful people are never content to stick with the status quo. Instead, they push themselves harder. #richdad
Take care of your teams because ultimately it is they, not you, who will enable you to achieve success. #richdad
Many people believe that it’s money that makes you rich.  The reality is that money can, and often does, make people poor.  It’s your context that makes you rich.  #financialeducation
One of the reasons people aren't rich is because almost everyone has more excuses than money.
Maintaining emotional intelligence during fear or crisis is one of the hardest things to do. It’s also one of the most important.
Wealth isn't about what you make; it's about how much you keep. #richdad
It’s stupid to work hard for money; work hard for knowledge.  Use other people’s money and energy to make you rich. #richdad
When you make a #mistake, consider it a blessing and an #opportunity to learn.  Just make sure you correct quickly. #richdad
The key is to spend your extra money to make more money; that's the financially intelligent thing to do.
Your poverty today is because of who you are. Want wealth? Let go of your anchors and inhibitions and change yourself. #richdad
Negative thoughts are not protecting you. They are making you smaller. #richdad
Being an entrepreneur is simply going from one mistake to the next. You must have the fortitude to continue on. #richdad
The biggest trap, the biggest dungeon in life is isn't laziness or bad luck, it's comfort. #richdad
It's true that money is not the most important thing in life, but money does affect everything that is important in life. #richdad
It’s easier to break apart than to stay together - this applies to marriage, business, etc. The best things in life take work, and lots of it. #richdad

Be careful of retirement plans. Often they tend to be ‘savings plans’ more than they are ‘investing plans’. Saving does not create wealth. #financialeducation
From a young age, we're taught to avoid mistakes. Instead, we should be encouraged to take on new challenges and learn from the mistakes along the way.
It's not about becoming rich; it's about attaining wealth. Rich is measured in dollars. Wealth is measured in time. #richdad
It's so hard to do it by yourself, nearly impossible. Build your team. #richdad

Your mind is not your friend. Your mind tells you why you can't. Your heart has your best interest. #richdad
The phrase, "It takes money to make money," drives me crazy. If you have a good idea or a great deal, and a team behind you, money will find you.

Entrepreneurs don't finish when we are tired. We finish when we are done. #Entrepreneurship
It’s not about the money. It's about creating a business out of your life’s purpose and mission. #richdad
An asset puts money in your pocket month after month. Does your personal home do that? Stop calling it an asset. #richdad
It’s not who was right or who was wrong when a mistake was made. It’s about who learned from it. #richdad
Rich dad would often say, “The primary difference between successful people and failing people is how they handle fear.”

Your ability to manage fear will dictate the level of success you can attain. #richdad
Call a child stupid and they'll believe you &amp; give up. Call them smart and they'll believe you &amp; expect everything to come easily. #BeAware
Be aware of the words you use. Are you using words like: "I'm going to...," "I'm trying...," "I'll start tomorrow?"  Your words become reality and will clearly show the action you are (or are not) taking.
Educate, empower, and trust your team. If you don't, your business will stay small. #richdad
When you think you are smart, you become arrogant.  When you are arrogant, you stop learning.  Never stop learning. #richdad
It is your self-doubt and your laziness that define and limit who you are. #richdad
Often, the more money you make the more money you spend; that’s why more money doesn’t make you rich – assets make you rich.
Being an entrepreneur is not a get-rich scheme; it takes strength of character to keep going. #richdad
Education's purpose is not to give you the answer, but to teach you HOW to think. Traditional school fails you on this point miserably. #richdad
True learning doesn't happen in your home.   It comes with getting out there and gaining experience.   #entrepreneur #investor
At the end of the day, one of the greatest educations you learn as you grow up is that most people around you won’t help you. You are responsible for you. #richdad
Think of something new you’ve actually learned in the past week; if you can’t think of anything, get comfortable where you’re at because you’re not going anywhere. To stop learning is to stop living.
Your mind ultimately is your greatest asset.    Be very careful of what advice you put in it and who gives it to you. #richdad

If you expect the government to solve your problems, you have a problem. The problem is that the governments of the world are broke. #financialeducation
You can only research and learn so much.  At some point you'll have to actually go out and do something with what you've learned.    If you don't, you'll be exactly where you were before you started educating yourself.  What's the point in that?
Why do people look to the government to fix the economy? It's mind-boggling. #financialeducation
There's really no excuse to not do something above and beyond your j.o.b.  Your financial future depends on it.
Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind. #richdad

Excuses are lame. Everybody has problems. It's what you do about those problems that makes the difference. #richdad
Think of something new you’ve actually learned in the past week; if you can’t think of anything, get comfortable where you’re at because you’re not going anywhere. To stop learning is to stop living.
The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. #richdad
"Gotta have money to make money" is a lame excuse. Not only that but it's wrong. If your investment or business makes sense, the money finds you. #richdad
Get your face out of your mobile phones. You're missing the opportunities all around you. You're also missing out on life. #richdad
The more you protect yourself from losing money, the more you protect yourself from making money. #richdad
Success takes work.  There's no way around it.    There are ways to make it "easier" like getting mentors, advisors, and good partners.  Don't kid yourself though.  It's still going to take hard work.
Schools were designed to create employees for the big corporations. Is that what you want for your children? #richdad
A goal is different from a wish. You may wish to be rich, but there's no responsibility for it. With a goal, it's on you to achieve it. #richdad
Schools manufacture people who think that they're smart but they're not. Schools also manufacture people who think that they're dumb but they're not.  Don't let school define who you are.

Complaining about your current position in life is worthless. Have a spine and do something about it instead. #richdad
If you're not willing to put in the work, your dream isn't important enough to you; nothing worth anything comes easily. #richdad
It's tragic to see people sell themselves short on what’s possible for their lives. Pull your head out and discover your possibilities. #richdad
Don’t be “reasonable;” it keeps your thinking inside the box and uncreative. "Reasonable" equals a job and no risk. #richdad
The losers in life think they have all the answers. They can’t learn because they’re too busy telling everyone what they know. #richdad
You can either blame everybody else or you can take a look at yourself and determine where you can improve. #richdad
Giving a poor person money keeps them poorer longer…often forever; give them knowledge instead. #richdad
It’s important that you learn to be an entrepreneur or an investor...not a saver.  Saving was for past generations when money was actually #money.  Share this if you know someone who has no idea what I'm talking about.  They need to know this more than anyone.
True learning doesn't happen on the couch. It happens when you get out, ask questions, view deals, and make mistakes. #richdad
The most successful people in life are the ones who ask questions. They’re always learning. They’re always growing. They’re always pushing. #richdad
Too many people have too many excuses when pursuing goals (financial and otherwise).  It's either important enough for you to do it or it's not. #richdad
Most people work all week to get to the weekend.  A few work all weekend for years to get to freedom. #richdad
You cannot solve a problem with the same brain that caused the problem; first you must change your mindset. #richdad
"Be bold. Do what the ordinary fear." This statement hits at the heart of every #entrepreneur.
If you're lazy, don't expect much in terms of success. You're owed nothing and success will not be given to you. It's earned. #richdad
To be truly wealthy, we must be able to give more than what we receive. #richdad
People need to wake up and realize that life doesn't wait for you.  If you want something, get up and go after it. #richdad
Learn by doing; that's where your real education happens. #richdad
If you're not willing to work for your success, you don't deserve it anyway.    People don't luck into success.  The successful are focused, passionate, and work hard. #richdad

Your journey to achieve financial security, and real wealth, is not easy and it's not short.   If you're not willing to put in the work over the long haul, get comfortable where you're at.
Millions of retirees, or soon-to-be retirees, live in fear of outliving their retirement savings.
When you put pressure on a man, you never know what he will turn into. It's exciting to find out though.

The more you protect yourself from losing money, the more you protect yourself from making money.
You won't learn if you think you already know everything.
Success takes work.  There's no way around it.    There are ways to make it "easier" like getting mentors, advisors, and good partners.  Don't kid yourself though.  It's still going to take hard work.
A goal is different from a wish. You may wish to be rich, but there's no responsibility for it. With a goal, it's on you to achieve it. #RichDad

The problem with school is you leave without knowing a thing about money...but you think you do.  That’s like satisfying your hunger by eating cardboard.

It's tragic to see people sell themselves short on what’s possible for their lives. Pull your head out and discover your possibilities. #richdad

We are teaching kids the Robin Hood philosophy of economics: "Take from the rich and give to the poor."  It's also known as socialism.
Cash flow is far different than profit. I strongly suggest you find the difference.  #financialeducation

Have the courage to overcome fear and do something for your financial future.  You should be more afraid if you don't. #richdad
Most people don’t even begin if they don’t know how.  Its because you don’t know that should make you want to start. Trust me; you’ll learn. #richdad

@ProtogenePro4 That's a poor mindset. Instead of saying, "I can't afford that" ask yourself, "How can I afford that." You'll have a much happier life.
@mattjcote Let's just say, I'm not worried if #SHTF
I don’t want the government taking care of me. I’ve never felt entitled to anything; being dependent on government is old-school thinking.
