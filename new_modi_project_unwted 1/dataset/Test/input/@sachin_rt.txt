They are regretting and hurting and will have to live with the consequences of their act. Spare a thought for their families as they have much to endure along with the players. Time for all of us to take a step back and give them some space.
Cricket has been known as a gentleman's game. It's a game that I believe should be played in the purest form. Whatever has happened is unfortunate but the right decision has been taken to uphold the integrity of the game. Winning is important but the way you win is more important
Cannot tell you how glad it makes me to know that you are following your dream. All the best for this challenging journey, @ArjunV_everest! #DreamsComeTrue https://t.co/OLndHWKBzG
