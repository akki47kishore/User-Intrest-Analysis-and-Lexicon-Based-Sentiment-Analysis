JW Prez @TomFitton on Mueller’s out-of-control probe: “This is a Special Counsel who, in my view, is a rogue prosecutor constitutionally.

Judicial Watch has demanded answers &amp; accountability on Special Counsel Mueller's out-of-control investigation for months. JW President @TomFitton: "Special Counsel Mueller’s operation is not above the law." Learn more about JW's continued efforts below.👇
https://t.co/2diBqMHtN1
JW Prez @TomFitton: “We still want Andrew McCabe's text messages. The McCabe firing again shows the need for a full investigation of the numerous anti-Trump &amp; other outrageous FBI abuses under Obama – as well as under McCabe’s mentor James Comey.” (11/11)
https://t.co/uHxS8wtM2q
JW Prez @TomFitton: “It is concerning that Andrew McCabe was allowed to remain in the FBI as long as he did. The FBI is not above the law and the American people deserve accountability.” (10/11)
https://t.co/uHxS8wtM2q
JW Prez @TomFitton said: “The FBI is compromised. McCabe should've been nowhere near the Clinton investigation. That he saw fit to recuse himself only days before the election further demonstrates the FBI’s Clinton email investigation was a sham.” (9/11)
https://t.co/sCyYonYBNs
Through our lawsuits, Judicial Watch uncovered documents from DOJ showing McCabe did not recuse himself from the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s illicit email server until November 1, 2016 − just one week prior to the presidential election. (8/11)
https://t.co/sCyYonYBNs
JW Prez @TomFitton said: “These docs show the FBI leadership was politicized &amp; compromised in its handling of the Clinton investigation. It's past time for a do-over on Clinton's emails that requires a new criminal investigation of her misconduct.” (7/11)
https://t.co/Fd7VnMwMnz
Through our lawsuits, Judicial Watch revealed that Andrew McCabe's wife received hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions from Clinton allies &amp; that Andrew McCabe even used official FBI resources for his wife’s political campaign. (6/11)
https://t.co/Fd7VnMwMnz
JW also filed a FOIA lawsuit with DOJ re: McCabe on behalf of retired FBI supervisory special agent Jeffrey A. Danik FBI’s who said: “I know I’m not the only retired (or serving) FBI agent who is concerned about Mr. McCabe’s conflicts of interest.” (5/11)
https://t.co/fZZMLnhYHl
JW's FOIA lawsuits with DOJ in 2017 sought: communications between FBI &amp; McCabe concerning ethical issues involving his wife’s political campaign, McCabe discussions with then Governor (&amp; Clinton ally) Terry McAuliffe, and McCabe's travel vouchers. (4/11)
https://t.co/xv05CUrBZZ
An important reminder that, through our litigation, Judicial Watch uncovered documents months ago showing McCabe's numerous conflicts of interest &amp; his recusal from the Clinton investigation only one week prior to the 2016 presidential election. (3/11)
https://t.co/iYD4ZHtobg
Judicial Watch President @TomFitton: “The FBI is not above the law. McCabe’s dishonesty taints both the Clinton email investigation and the Russia collusion investigation targeting President Trump – including Special Counsel Mueller's operation.” (2/11)

Big Court Win: A federal judge in JW's case ordered State Dept to speed up processing of Clinton’s emails – ordering completion of processing remaining docs by Sept. 28, 2018 &amp; accelerating the production rate which would’ve continued til 2020 or later. https://t.co/SML77Ji1IM

Judicial Watch President @TomFitton: “Lives were lost in Parkland because the Sheriff’s Office personnel were either poorly trained or failed to follow training protocols.” (10/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Judicial Watch President @TomFitton: “These Broward County Sheriff’s Office documents obtained by Judicial Watch show that the law enforcement agency failed the victims of the Parkland shooting victims.” (9/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Sheriff Scott Israel was also eligible for $2000 in supplemental pay for completing a 20-hr training course. In 2016, the Sheriff received a warning letter that he had not successfully completed the course &amp; his supplemental pay was being withheld. (8/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Additional records obtained by Judicial Watch also show that Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel is the second highest paid of all of Florida’s 67 sheriffs – at $186,631 for Fiscal Year 2017/2018. (7/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
The lesson plan says: “If you are on scene &amp; hear gunshots, you should immediately access what you have &amp; prepare to respond. Remember, every time you hear a gunshot in an active shooter incident, you have to believe another victim is being killed.” (6/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Lesson plan also says to immediately confront a shooter: “History shows when a suspect is confronted by any armed individual... they either shoot it out with that person or kill themselves. Either way, the shooting of innocent bystanders must stop.” (5/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Using the lessons learned from Columbine (the 1999 high school shooting massacre where officers waited for SWAT &amp; allowed two shooters to continue) the first four responding officers are directed to form a “Quad” &amp; to approach from all directions. (4/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Three more deputies also arrived on scene but didn’t enter. The Broward County materials direct that if four officers are on scene at an active shooter incident they are to form a “Quad” formation &amp; enter the building – which they failed to do. (3/10)
https://t.co/68WjbIqNp3
Broward County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that armed school resource officer Deputy Scot Peterson was first on scene at the Feb. 14th shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, but he didn’t enter the school to confront shooter Nikolas Cruz. (2/10)

JW still wants answers: JW filed a FOIA lawsuit against State Dept for the truth about improper #Unmasking, leaking, &amp; other efforts tied to Obama UN Ambassador Samantha Power's involvement in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. https://t.co/Z2NqyyzSUi

A reminder from JW Prez @TomFitton about some Trump Admin officials stonewalling on Clinton: "This DOJ, State Dept, &amp; Director of National Intel — Sessions, Tillerson, &amp; Coats — don't want to do a damage assessment of Clinton's emails as the law requires." https://t.co/56vTAjLXP4 https://t.co/XLdJwJYDtP

After the infamous #Clinton-#Lynch tarmac meeting, docs obtained by Judicial Watch show the #FBI worked to cover it up. Emails show the FBI's leaders seemed concerned not about the meeting itself, but instead about the whistleblower who got the word out. https://t.co/3lCLr40ce1
JW filed a FOIA lawsuit w/ DOJ for FBI docs on Comey’s forthcoming memoir — FBI officials are usually required to submit the transcript for pre-publication review. JW wants to see if Comey got special treatment like he did when he leaked info to the media. https://t.co/NWXvppCjHa

Judicial Watch President @TomFitton: "Once again, the Deep State Justice Department is covering up evident misconduct targeting President Trump… The DOJ needs to come clean about this scandal and turn over the documents as federal law requires." (8/8)
https://t.co/9GAahMCs6Z
Judicial Watch President @TomFitton: "Bruce Ohr, a top Justice Department official in the Obama administration, had an obvious conflict of interest through his wife Nellie’s work with the Clinton/DNC vendor Fusion GPS on the anti-Trump Dossier." (7/8)
https://t.co/9GAahMCs6Z
The House GOP’s House Intel memo / Nunes memo also states: “This clear evidence of Steele’s bias was recorded by [Bruce] Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files – but not reflected in any of the [Carter] Page FISA applications.” (6/8)
https://t.co/9GAahMCs6Z
The Nunes memo notes Steele maintained contact with Bruce Ohr: “Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate Trump when Steele said he ‘was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.’” (5/8)
https://t.co/9GAahMCs6Z
JW’s FOIA request on Nellie Ohr seeks all records of communication including emails, text messages, and instant chats, between DOJ officials in the Attorney General’s Office and Fusion GPS employee or contractor Nellie Ohr. (4/8)

Until his dossier-related demotion, Bruce Ohr was 4th-ranked official at DOJ &amp; a contact for Steele. The House GOP Intel / Nunes memo says Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS to cultivate oppo research on Trump &amp; that Bruce Ohr gave it to the FBI. (2/8)

Judicial Watch filed suit against DOJ, NYC, &amp; the NYPD to compel them to release info regarding the April 14, 1972 unsolved murder of police officer Phillip Cardillo at a mosque in Harlem. Rank-and-file NYPD officers want answers on Cardillo's murder too. https://t.co/5lNOvjJPKC
Still looking for answers: JW sued the Dept of Treasury for the truth about the Clinton State Dept &amp; Obama Admin involvement in the corrupt #UraniumOneDeal that could've placed our national security at risk — DOJ should investigate any Clinton involvement. https://t.co/LgUP4OTgWn
The case of the Russian Dossier got stranger w/ new report about a “second Trump-Russia dossier” seen by Christopher Steele &amp; turned over to FBI that was compiled by Cody Shearer — a close associate of Sid Blumenthal (himself a close Clinton confidant). https://t.co/EMs23Vm0bq

After the infamous #Clinton-#Lynch tarmac meeting, docs obtained by Judicial Watch show the #FBI worked to cover it up. Emails show the FBI's leaders seemed concerned not about the meeting itself, but instead about the whistleblower who got the word out. https://t.co/3lCLr40ce1
Reminder: Back when he was FBI Director, Mueller worked w/ Islamist orgs — including ISNA &amp; CAIR (unindicted co-conspirators in the HolyLandFoundation terror case) — to purge the FBI's anti-terror training manuals of material deemed "offensive" to Muslims. https://t.co/FsfdgdPoBu
Judicial Watch wants to know whether Special Counsel #Mueller, former FBI Director #Comey, &amp; the DOJ coordinated prior to #Comey's testimony in front of the Senate Intel Committee on June 8, 2017. And so we filed a FOIA lawsuit with DOJ seeking the truth! https://t.co/BIXNQer9u0
Andrew McCabe is the outgoing Deputy Director of the FBI whose wife received $700k from Clinton allies &amp; who recused himself from the Clinton investigation one week prior to the 2016 election — and the FBI is stonewalling JW on McCabe's text messages too. https://t.co/iYD4ZHbMMG

DOJ &amp; FBI have stonewalled on releasing the bombshell Strzok &amp; Page texts for months — it's why JW filed a FOIA lawsuit for access not just to the texts, but to all the emails, chats, &amp; other communications between Strzok &amp; Page from Feb 1, 2015 thru now. https://t.co/Ln1bZko5CJ

Weekly Update: In its final year the Obama Admin may have used our nation’s spy apparatus to unmask members of the Trump campaign &amp; leak info to the press. Obama’s U.N. ambassador Samantha Power may have engaged in unmasking – and JW wants to know more. https://t.co/rsLTUnWuZg
Wow: An IG report revealed VA Chief of Staff Vivieca Wright— who JW already showed misled VA Secretary Shulkin about the prosecution of an elderly Army vet— also made false claims &amp; altered an official record in a separate case involving an overseas trip. https://t.co/xeEU9CoFfF
Tip Sheet: FBI will review 16,750 pages of Comey docs after JW lawsuit. JW sues State Dept for Samantha Power unmasking docs. An illegal alien in drug bust was deported three times but re-entered country. Deep-dive on Clintons, Arkansas, &amp; FBI. And more! https://t.co/PpJ4z2IRBT

Judicial Watch wants to know whether Special Counsel #Mueller, former FBI Director #Comey, &amp; the DOJ coordinated prior to #Comey's testimony in front of the Senate Intel Committee on June 8, 2017. And so we filed a FOIA lawsuit with DOJ seeking the truth! https://t.co/BIXNQer9u0

"Rumors have floated for months of a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Judicial Watch keeps turning up new evidence of Clinton pay-to-play &amp; mishandling classified info. But smelling a rat in Arkansas when it comes to the Clintons is not new." https://t.co/2XvwpPSnBo

The case of the Russian Dossier got stranger w/ new report about a “second Trump-Russia dossier” seen by Christopher Steele &amp; turned over to FBI that was compiled by Cody Shearer — a close associate of Sid Blumenthal (himself a close Clinton confidant). https://t.co/EMs23Vm0bq

The DOJ refuses to release the budget for Special Counsel #Mueller's out-of-control investigation. JW is seeking this info through a FOIA lawsuit — we believe American taxpayers deserve accountability &amp; answers. No one is above the law — not even Mueller. https://t.co/hPGyQKwSip

Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the FBI for records about the removal &amp; reassignment of #PeterStrzok – a former official at the FBI – who was removed from Special Counsel’s #RobertMueller’s investigative team reportedly due to political bias. https://t.co/MQDTnT4lNo
The Huma Abedin emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop emphasize the need for DOJ to conduct a new &amp; serious investigation of Clinton &amp; Abedin violations of law. And JW is pleased to learn DOJ has reportedly begun asking questions re: Clinton classified info. https://t.co/9hdRZNI93l
After the infamous #Clinton-#Lynch tarmac meeting, docs obtained by Judicial Watch show the #FBI worked to cover it up. Emails show the FBI's leaders seemed concerned not about the meeting itself, but instead about the whistleblower who got the word out. https://t.co/3lCLr40ce1
Reminder: Back when he was FBI Director, Mueller worked w/ Islamist orgs — including ISNA &amp; CAIR (unindicted co-conspirators in the HolyLandFoundation terror case) — to purge the FBI's anti-terror training manuals of material deemed "offensive" to Muslims. https://t.co/FsfdgdxNcU

As part of our effort to hold Mueller's investigation accountable, JW uncovered docs showing top DOJ officials including Andrew Weissmann — a key prosecutor on Mueller’s team — praising Obama holdover Sally Yates for lawlessly thwarting Trump's travel ban. https://t.co/fw7xXh4YH5
Through the course of JW's litigation, DOJ compared Comey to WikiLeaks and admitted some of the info he leaked may have even contained classified info. JW has DOJ confirmation that Comey was wrong to leak his memos to his friend (&amp; attorney) and the media. https://t.co/9UP60UrBj0
