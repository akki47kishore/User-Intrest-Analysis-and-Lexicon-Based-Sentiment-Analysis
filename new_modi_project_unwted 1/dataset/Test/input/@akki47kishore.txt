@mehanats @Zakka_Jacob @ChennaiIPL Mate this is illogical ...sure its a pressing issue but this isn't how you deal with it... if you want to throw shoes at someone throw at it your dumb politicians. People's victory ? Are u being naive or stupid?? Have you got your river now ?? Oh wait u didn't??
@RohitAugust Remind me again how msd, rohit Sharma,Raina and kholi fared in their respective matches on flatter wickets??? Atleast yuvraj was in position where he could absorb the dot balls and the team would still be safe

Plus u r only allowed 4 fielders outside the 30 yard circle .u can't cover the whole ground. if u have square leg and a mid wicket fine leg would open up smith yes is an exceptional case as his batting is unorthodox
@knittins @Vishal1686 guess you missd the 150 vs Eng &amp; 62 vs pak where he kept thrashing the short pitch deliveries.he's way better than he used to https://t.co/gMXQA7WyTa every batsman has a weakness even kholi,rohit &amp; msd .on their day whatever u bowl they'll smash it to all parts of the ground

@SirJadeja_Real Dhoni himself said everyones views should be respected after hearing the criticisms against him.... but dumbass fans feel these legends are mindless.. by the way dhoni won those trophies only cause he had a great team esp(yuvi(2007-11) dhawan 2013 ct) not just because of himself

@SliceofFeelings @AshmiJhaa @SirJadeja I dunno about all wickets but they did get kholi because dhoni denied him the strike and it was dhoni who got the rr from 12.5 to 18

@manimanu1498 @SUNNYNANNURI @SirJadeja No dhoni is a share holder of jk cement that's actually one of the owners of csk.. so u stop barking and get ur facts straight
@manimanu1498 @SUNNYNANNURI @SirJadeja Ya but there was dhawan
@SUNNYNANNURI @SirJadeja True that.... stop taking credit for what someone else did....the entire team contributed in winning those trophies
@SirJadeja Even vvs laxman and Akash chopra feel he should retire.do you really think laxman never touched a bat🙏🙏🙏🙏
 He is qualified to lecture dhoni
@SirJadeja Going at 6 an over when team needs 12 not an easy task either
@SirJadeja India wins "Dhoni the real captain da"
India lost " the rest of the team didnt play well so why should dhoni play well Atleast he is not out
@SirJadeja Fans logic- hit a six , then waste 5 balls.... dhoni  da awesome da
@SirJadeja he took the match to the end???? The match was over the moment dhoni came into bat
@SirJadeja We saw how good a partnership he was building... the only thing he did was keep kholi off strike
@RoyalViratian I meant Odis too
@RoyalViratian This is crap... this is all time most popular players not all time best match winners....where is kapil dev, sunny paji etc

I love @viewbug #photocontest https://t.co/oonzLaezUw
@cricbuzz It's not villain it's villani
@jitzvijan03 nah if ur considering strike rate she should definitely replace dhoni esp if one compares the last time dhoni batted
@rockyandmayur It's saying "sleep will solve all my problems " so yea I'm guessing he's nice
@kanugula_sai @YuviWorld What's that supposed to mean
@Ammy_SN85 @YuviWorld Oh yea pant really played well so well that yuvi doesn't have any place
How many more matches before sports page editors start criticizing pant and Karthik
@webanup Just saw some stats and kholi averages 73 after being captain in odi's. kholi has played better individually after he became captain
@cricbuzz Has the teams been selected?
@hankypanty When has he scored 36 in an over .... last time he played he couldn't get 3.6 an over
@rockyandmayur Ya but according to scientists  that day is still 4000 years away
@selfamused Isn't that the same as don't quit.... so why split it in the first place
@Akashpandey_ @bhogleharsha Jadeja got out before dhoni
@YuviWorld @YUVSTRONG12 What the heck is wrong with u ..... do u think someone an beat cancer and come back this much without GODs help
@webanup I agree
@webanup Kholi and gabbar are india's top run scorers this yr.Pant is dhoni's backup not Karthik.y do u think pandya and jadhav couldn't score freely
@webanup Dhoni's replacement isn't Karthik it's pant
@webanup Why r u blaming kholi India was in a position to win dhoni just couldn't finish it. Kholi led India to the ct17 finals too.cant win evrythin
@imsharmarahul @bhogleharsha Pant is a keeper not all rounder... yuvi performed better than both in ipl, and better than dhoni in both ct17 and against England
@RjFaizan25 @Saj_PakPassion Mate he has done more this country than u ever could so yea no one is gonna give ur tweet any importance
@rejivar25 No both those players are playing accrdin to their game esp rahane.isn't someone who can shift gears that easily. 1 of them needed to attack
@nileshab186 Most people like dhoni.jst his stupid fans that blindly supprt him that gets him so much hate.Its a bad innings,take it on d chin &amp; move on
@AddictedToMSN @Beghairatladka People don't blame the captain they blame the person who cost match
@kk2012_kumar @imVkohli Pandya, Karthik and jadhav all got chances to finish it.did they do it? Even in ct17 final
Why do people still say give youngsters chance
@NavneetBaitha @msdhoni @imVkohli What good condition ... We lost there is no good loss and bad loss. By the way rahane played well
@rockyandmayur All of the above.... infact if it's food I like it ... unless of course it's vegan or weird like scorpions and dogs like in China
@shubhsshukla99 @iAshish08 If it's not so much pressure why didn't we win even with me cool at the crease. Also the rate came down because of pandyas run a ball 23
@webanup No one said they were good their fans keep quiet.... only msd fans keep trying to justify him. Like great 50 well played and stuff.
@imsharmarahul @bhogleharsha I'm not thinking about 5 - 10 years now we have to think about the coming wc which is just 1.5 yrs
@DhoniFangirl As much as I respect dhoni... he tried to not get out and forgot about the chase
@DhoniFangirl oh they didn't sacrifice it mate.... they lost their wickets trying to get a move on... someone had to
@webanup What big defeat? There's only a win or a loss . it was 190 not 350.rotation of strike was enough there was no need to take the match so deep
@webanup Yea wickets will fall when someone keeps wasting the deliveries .... it puts unnecessary pressure on the Newman coming to score quickly
@imsharmarahul @bhogleharsha and for ur information yuvraj was the mom in 2 out of Indias last 10 games and has an avg of 40 this year then how can u say he's struggling
@imsharmarahul @bhogleharsha Pant is a keeper not an all rounder with the current balance he'll not fit... esp if pandya has an offday
@DhoniFangirl That tends to happen when you don't get any balls to play and others are using up overs not scoring
@A_jj1510 @arihant @nirupam89 @SirJadeja Yes but those were big totals were it's best to drag the game to the last over
@shubhsshukla99 @iAshish08 No one said he had to play big shots he just had to rotate strike....and no Indian batting line up isnt that bad.was just dot ball pressure
@imsharmarahul @bhogleharsha So has yuvi ,hasn't played that much domestic cricket but his average this season was good which was why he came back in the first place
@TheYorkerBall Ya but yuvi was on 90s from 80 odd deliveries..... that was pretty much a lone fight
@webanup Maybe but they only got to play 83 deliveries
@aayushi07rathi @SirJadeja No that was yuvraj and rahane but dhoni and jadhav finished well though
@drsugangee @msdhoni I really don't think bows the best time for that ,a day ago this tweet  would have had more likes
@shubhsshukla99 @iAshish08 Ya sure removing dhoni India needs 54 runs from 114 deliveries
@shivams7187 @SirJadeja Why would India need 50 overs its 190 should have finished it in 40
@arihant @nirupam89 @A_jj1510 @SirJadeja Uh question who among these players is supposed to be Indias finisher? Should the finisher have a better strike rate than the rest
@TweeterHimachal This is why
@_DRaval U did see the match right?
@ab5cb9ad166a433 @cricbuzz Oh really how good were ur youngsters ..... both pandya and jadhav came in when the required rate was manageable
@Ripsylobo12 Wow Karthik said that on air
@_DRaval Mate ur chasing 190 u finish it in 40 overs , u don't go the full 50 overs... it's not 290
@bhogleharsha when was the last time u saw a team needing so much in the last over while chasing 190
@imsharmarahul @bhogleharsha Can I know why pant.....experience is one thing but if u are going by ipl 2017 both yuvraj and dhoni have better averages than him
