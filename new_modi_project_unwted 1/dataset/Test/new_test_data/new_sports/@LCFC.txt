Listen to live post-match reaction on https://t.co/RY4JEGCsE7 now. https://t.co/iVfRoa1Lxj
It's all over at King Power Stadium... #LeiNew https://t.co/5Iumn23qXG
GOAL! Leicester pull one back. Okazaki heads the ball back across the box and Vardy smashes it in from close range.

#LeiNew https://t.co/joIsULeTEi
Goal. Newcastle are 2-0 up. Perez lifts the shot over Schmeichel to double the lead. 

Leicester also make their final change, with Gray replacing Diabate.

#LeiNew
20 minutes left. Leicester are still behind, but are keeping the pressure up playing the ball into the box, but Newcastle are defending well.

#LeiNew
Good spell of chances for Leicester, as Silva sees his shot deflected wide and Mahrez's attempt is blocked. 

#LeiNew
Second change for Leicester and it's an attacking one as Okazaki comes on for Simpson, with Albrighton going to right-back. Diabate and Mahrez now on either flank.

#LeiNew
Leicester are still pushing for an equaliser. Vardy gets in behind, but the cross is cut out at the near post. Meanwhile, Gayle and Ritchie are booked for Newcastle. 

#LeiNew
Back underway at King Power Stadium.

The Foxes trail by one... COME ON, CITY!

Listen live to the second half 📻 https://t.co/UcuU5Pyy8l

#LeiNew https://t.co/LS4muDjMHm
Half-time: Leicester City 0️⃣-1️⃣ Newcastle United

Jonjo Shelvey's early effort is the difference at half time, with work to do for the Foxes after the break.

#LeiNew https://t.co/5liuubRbky
First change for Leicester as Iborra picks up a knock. He's replaced by Academy graduate Choudhury. 

#LeiNew
Penalty appeal from the home fans as Dummett appears to bring down Mahrez after a brilliant pass from Silva. Nothing given.

#LeiNew
Silva is getting through plenty of work alongside Iborra in the #lcfc midfield, while up front the lively Diabaté breaks free of the defence with a trick only to see his shot flash wide. Better from #lcfc 👍

#LeiNew https://t.co/yCiJYXCAuD
Still 1️⃣-0️⃣ to the visitors here at King Power Stadium as the Foxes push hard to get back on level terms, but Newcastle are well-drilled. 

Listen live to the action as it unfolds 📻 https://t.co/UcuU5Pyy8l

#LeiNew https://t.co/eUT0cTF2nX
Leicester are pushing for an equaliser. Albrighton is getting into some good positions, but as yet they've not been able to test the Newcastle goalkeeper.

#LeiNew
Goal. Newcastle are ahead. Shelvey gives them the lead with a deflected shot from the edge of the box.  

#LeiNew
Leicester building momentum now as Morgan heads the ball wide. Silva putting in some work in midfield. Still goalless. 

#LeiNew
Early pressure from Newcastle who get the first chance of the game after winning a corner. Schmeichel dives left to force it out for another corner which is cleared.

#LeiNew
Business time at King Power Stadium 💼

Sliding into the #BankHoliday Weekend like...

#BhaLei https://t.co/vwQeaMtHdT
CLAUDE: “@Ndidi25 is a crucial player for us, so it’s difficult to accept this red card. We will have to find a good solution for the coming games without him.” #BriLei
CLAUDE: “We have had games this season where we didn’t get as much as we deserved, so we’ll take the result today. We have to continue to give everything and to play well from the start of every game.” #BriLei
CLAUDE: “The penalty save was a crucial moment and, in the minds of my players, it gave them the belief to go on and win the game. It was hard for Brighton to recover from that, but congratulations to my players for capitalising.” #BriLei
CLAUDE: “I don’t know if it’s a fair result, but it’s an important three points and we’ll take it. It was important we came back from the break with the right attitude and we showed that.” #BriLei
IBORRA: “Winning today started with @kschmeichel1’s save. After that, we started to believe. We scored two important goals, but it was only possible because of that save from Kasper.” #BriLei
Today's LCFC Radio summariser, @Gerry_Taggart gives his full-time verdict on #BhaLei 📻⬇️

Listen to live post-match reaction on https://t.co/RY4JEGCsE7 now. https://t.co/IOrRi7mUjh
Full-time at the AMEX Stadium. Brighton 0-2 Leicester City #BhaLei https://t.co/MHzvy3X0Bu
GOALLL! VARDY SEALS THE THREE POINTS!

2️⃣-0️⃣. Game over. 

#BhaLei https://t.co/fdkTLUmuql
Heroics from Schmeichel to keep the resulting March free kick from dipping into the net. Fuchs also on now as #lcfc look to see out the match. #BhaLei
Second yellow card for Ndidi as he's booked for a foul on Duffy. #lcfc down to 10 men with just a few minutes left.

#BhaLei
IBORRAAAAAAAAAA! YESSSSSSSS! 

Chilwell's cross and a bullet header into the net by Iborra!

IT'S 1️⃣-0️⃣ TO THE FOXES! 

#BhaLei https://t.co/ZeEduPdeI4
Second change...

▶️ Gray
◀️ Albrighton

#BhaLei
SCHMEICHEL SAVES! 🙌

Murray goes to the 'keeper's left and he gets two hands to the ball. 

Still 0️⃣-0️⃣... COME ON, CITY! 💪🦊

#BhaLei https://t.co/gdwSQmV7iW
Penalty to Brighton...

#BhaLei
Second half substitute @F_diabate33 does well to turn as the Foxes push forward at the AMEX Stadium. #BhaLei https://t.co/MQouPhvS1f
City improving with some intricate football on the edge of the Brighton 18-yard box, but Brighton are very well-organised and a clever back heel from Vardy doesn't quite catch them out. #BhaLei
Maguire now booked for a foul on Schelotto with both teams pushing hard for that opening goal now. #BhaLei
Chilwell and Simpson into the book for fouls, making it three of City's back four on yellow cards. Still, neither side has really been able to put the opposition goalkeeper to the test.

Just over 2️⃣5️⃣ to play, still 0️⃣-0️⃣...

#BhaLei
.@Mahrez22 shakes off a Brighton challenge to get the Foxes on the front foot. #BhaLei https://t.co/EMvCJf6DIv
First Foxes change...

▶️ Diabaté
◀️ Okazaki

Diabaté goes in behind Vardy as #lcfc continue in what looks to be a 4-2-3-1. 

#BhaLei
Great tracking from Maguire to deny Izquierdo, who was tearing away down the left before cutting inside and seeing his shot blocked by the City no.15. #BhaLei
#lcfc's Marc Albrighton glides past Pascal Gross as the Foxes launch an attack early in the second half. #BhaLei https://t.co/lJuCCpuTLb
Back underway in Brighton. No goals so far and no changes for either side. 

Big 4️⃣5️⃣ minutes ahead... 

Listen live: https://t.co/bDLhZd3LtN

#BhaLei https://t.co/RFI9ETkfCS
Half-time on the south coast. Brighton 0-0 Leicester City #BhaLei https://t.co/RZ8ljkhAqM
Best chance of the match so far and it falls to Glenn Murray. The striker latches onto a through ball but puts his finish just inches wide of the post.

Meanwhile at the other end Mahrez jinks inside onto his left and forces a good save down low. 

Still 0️⃣-0️⃣...

#BhaLei
Ndidi the second Foxes player booked after a foul on Kayal as both teams look to hit each other on the counter, but with neither 'keeper really tested so far. 

#BhaLei
Clever set-play routine from #lcfc as Mahrez and Albrighton work a headed chance for Iborra, but Ryan makes the catch as the ball looped towards the top corner. Still goalless, 2️⃣0️⃣ minutes played.

#BhaLei
.@vardy7 puts Shane Duffy under pressure as the Brighton man looks to shepherd the ball out of play. #BhaLei https://t.co/7pHKkHyXAm
Morgan goes into the book for the Foxes after his foul prevents Brighton striking on the counter. Both sides looking dangerous in possession at the AMEX. 

Listen live: https://t.co/bDLhZd3LtN

#BhaLei https://t.co/Qnqvsq17cY
The front four of #lcfc working their socks off to hurry Brighton in possession, with Okazaki in particular making his presence felt. No chances for either side just yet though.

🔴 OFF! Swans defender Davies goes in late on Martis on the left flank, prompting the referee to reach for his red card. #lcfcu23s
GOAL! Hughes is in the right place at the right time to dent Swansea's lead in south Wales. It's now 3-1. #lcfcu23s https://t.co/OUssSIr0cA
Thomas comes off in City's final substitution of the night, replaced by Pascanu. #lcfcu23s
Goal. It's 3-0 to Swansea as Byers nods it into the bottom corner for his second of the night. #lcfcu23s
Another attacking change from the #lcfcu23s...

▶️ Martis
◀️ Johnson

Just under half-an-hour to go in Wales.
The Foxes are keeping Swansea penned in at the back, although their hosts have had the answers so far. Better from the #lcfcu23s.
The second half is upon us in Swansea and the #lcfcu23s will have Eppiah on in Kaba Sherif's place for the remaining 45 minutes. 

They trail 2️⃣-0️⃣ here. COME ON!

Goal. Swansea counter and Gorrè picks his spot into the bottom corner. It's 2-0 to the hosts. #lcfcu23s
There will be 3️⃣ additional minutes in this first half - and it's the Foxes pushing for a late goal... #lcfcu23s
Looking for a quick-fire equaliser, Johnson charges into the box and fires it at goal, but it whistles wide of the near post. Come on, City! 👏

#lcfcu23s
Goal. The Swans take the lead as Byers lashes it into the top of Bramley's net from the edge of the penalty area. #lcfcu23s
Gordon! 😱 A smart cross from Barnes flashes across goal, but the #lcfcu23s forward can't get a touch on it! Close.
Home 'keeper Benda has been kept busy by the Foxes' front-three, most recently getting a hand to Gordon's long-range drive.

Swansea 0️⃣-0️⃣ #lcfcu23s 👍
Barnes plays an exquisite cross-field pass for Thomas on the right flank. The Wales U21s international takes it down and hits it. Blocked. 😞

Lovely flowing football on show from the #lcfcu23s so far in south Wales.

Good response from the Foxes. Okazaki injects some pace into the move, finds Mahrez, who pings a ball to the far post that just eludes Vardy and Gray by a matter of inches.

At the other end, Krychowiak hits the crossbar with a deflected shot. Phew. #WbaLei
Goal. Rondon gives West Brom a 1️⃣-0️⃣ lead 😤

Burke gets into space on the right and crosses into the six-yard box, where Rondon applies the finish.

@kschmeichel1 seemed to enjoy that 97th minute equaliser for @LCFC...

#LEIBOU https://…
CLAUDE: “It’s an important point for us because we gave our best and deserved to get something. We have to try our best to use the finale of this game to build some momentum.” #LeiBou
CLAUDE: “@Mahrez22 is a valuable player for us. He always shows a positive attitude. I’m happy for him because he always wants to give his best for the team.” #LeiBou
CLAUDE: “I thought we deserved something. We created so many chances second half without scoring - it was crazy. We always want more than a point at home, but I was pleased with the mentality of the team.” #LeiBou
🔮

#LeiBou https://t.co/70cT7X9XfF
MAHREZ: “Tough game. We had to change the shape first half, which was difficult, but we created a lot of chances in the second. I thought we deserved a draw. In a game as close as that, it only takes one moment to get something.” #LeiBou

Mahrez magic in stoppage time earns #lcfc a point 😁

#LeiBou https://t.co/CK7FZuDSs4
GOALLLLLLLLLLL! MAHREZZZZZ YESSSSSSSS!

UNBELIEVABLE FREE KICK! 

1️⃣-1️⃣

#LeiBou https://t.co/2ll5qbWeCp
▶️ Diabaté
◀️ Fuchs
Final change for #lcfc with just over 🔟 minutes to play and the visitors still leading by a goal...

▶️ Fuchs
◀️ Diabaté

COME ON, CITY!

#LeiBou
#lcfc getting into better positions as we head into the final 20 minutes in search of an equaliser, but they haven't been able to test Begović enough this half.

Listen live: https://t.co/QfrAOfftZS

#LeiBou https://t.co/36XxMslpBz
Still trailing by a goal but better from #lcfc as Vardy and Mahrez put the defence under pressure before Morgan sees a header go over the bar from a good position. COME ON, CITY! 

#LeiBou https://t.co/rEsHAHLoXt
Second change for #lcfc as Chilwell's long range shot gets deflected over the crossbar. Better from the Foxes. 

▶️ Iheanacho
◀️ Silva

#LeiBou https://t.co/mOfZkCRFQ1
City trying to force the issue in the second half at King Power Stadium but Bournemouth are proving difficult to break down. Mahrez has moved up alongside Vardy in attack. #LeiBou https://t.co/edqTGYUJLd
Half-time: Leicester City 0️⃣-1️⃣ AFC Bournemouth

Work to do for the Foxes after the break as Josh King's penalty separates the sides.

#LeiBou https://t.co/f9eN2ZOLdT
Goal. King sends the ball past Schmeichel from 12 yards.

The Foxes trail 1️⃣-0️⃣

#LeiBou
Penalty to Bournemouth as Albrighton fouls King just inside the box.

#LeiBou
Vardy's pace in behind remains City's best threat, but it's Bournemouth who are creating the chances at the moment - King and Wilson going very close to breaking the deadlock.

Still 0️⃣-0️⃣, with 3️⃣0️⃣ minutes played. 

#LeiBou https://t.co/GxE4hej4nJ
First change for #lcfc after Amartey picks up a knock. Chilwell on in his place as #lcfc look to have switched to three at the back. We think... 🕵️‍♀️

▶️ Chilwell
◀️ Amartey

#LeiBou
Best chance of the match so far falls to Mahrez, but on his right foot, as the winger races through but sees his shot saved by Begovic. Foxes looking good.

Listen live: https://t.co/QfrAOfftZS

#LeiBou https://t.co/oE5gbGmB1V
Positive start from the Foxes with Mahrez and Albrighton both trying to find Vardy's runs in behind the Bournemouth back line, but no breakthrough yet. 

#LeiBou
Three changes for #lcfc. Silva, Amartey and Fuchs in.

CLAUDE: “We needed greater desire to score, to attack the box together. We did it at times, but not consistently enough. When we did, their goalkeeper made some fantastic saves.” #LeiSto
CLAUDE: “I thought we started well, with intensity, but it became too slow to find space. It was better second half, but without a clinical edge or a little luck to find a winning goal.” #LeiSto
CLAUDE: “Not enough to win today. We could have, but we could also have lost so perhaps a draw is fair. Their goalkeeper made some good saves, but we also conceded chances.” #LeiSto

Full-time: Leicester City 1️⃣-1️⃣ Stoke City

The Foxes are held to a 1-1 draw at King Power Stadium despite a late flurry of chances.

#LeiStk https://t.co/svdKaVzBph
Mahrez! He goes through one-on-one but Butland makes a great save!

A corner follows and James heads against the post!

Just a few minutes remaining...

#LeiStk
So close to a second for #lcfc as Mahrez sees a great effort tipped wide by Butland, before Maguire rattles the upright and Albrighton has one blocked. Getting better! #LeiStk https://t.co/6lhTKRDzGq
GOALLLLLL! #LCFC ARE LEVEL!

Great cross from Albrighton and it deflects in at the near post off Butland.

1️⃣-1️⃣

#LeiStk https://t.co/WuBFiaT66L
Double change for the Foxes on the hour...

▶️ Iheanacho
▶️ Diabate
◀️ Simpson
◀️ Gray

COME ON, CITY! 

#LeiStk
#lcfc pressing forward in search of the equaliser but leaving themselves vulnerable on the counter as Shaqiri very nearly adds a second after a quick turnover of possession. #LeiStk https://t.co/4ka7HrEpvg
Underway in the second half, with the Foxes trailing to Shaqiri's strike.

No changes. COME ON, CITY!

#LeiStk
Half-time: Leicester City 0️⃣-1️⃣ Stoke City

Shaqiri's goal late in the first half is the difference. Work to do for the Foxes.

Listen live to the second half in the Match Centre 📻 https://t.co/KSDRy2f9aA

#LeiStk https://t.co/fIg1lYvRce
Goal 😤

Shaqiri leads a Stoke City break and fires into the bottom corner from 20 yards to give the visitors the lead.

0️⃣-1️⃣

#LeiStk
Still goalless at King Power Stadium with five minutes remaining until the break.

#lcfc pushing hard to unlock the Stoke City defence...

Listen live: https://t.co/KSDRy2f9aA

#LeiStk https://t.co/8nqJVg6Er2
Foxes looking dangerous out wide as they push for the first goal, with Mahrez testing Butland from a left foot volley. Stoke doing a good job of keeping tabs on Maguire and Morgan at set plays. 

Listen live: https://t.co/KSDRy2f9aA

#LeiStk https://t.co/wT6vRKyOiV
Foxes in control after 1️⃣5️⃣ minutes as they continue to look for space in behind with Vardy, while Ndiaye tested Schmeichel with a low shot for the visitors. Well saved. #LeiSky
Strong start for the Foxes as they force a succession of corners. The last of which gives James a shooting chance that goes just over. High tempo so far.

GOOOAAALLLLL! JAMIE VARDY HEADS LEICESTER AHEAD!

Mahrez to the far post where Vardy meets it with a stunning header back across goal!

1️⃣-0️⃣

#LeiShu https://t.co/AIrrgjVwZC
Foxes keeping the pressure on as we approach the hour mark at King Power Stadium.

Mahrez is causing problems on the run while Vardy's pace almost created an opening for Iheanacho, but still no breakthrough.

#LeiShu https://t.co/6PPvAemSFc
Back underway! 

Come on, City! 

#LeiShu https://t.co/Fh8dghYoTU
Half-time: Leicester City 0️⃣-0️⃣ Sheffield United

#lcfc with the better chances in the first half but still all-square and all to play for after the break.

Listen live: https://t.co/B8Xfnn41jH

#LeiShu https://t.co/u5rZuolcCh
Vardy goes close again! Mahrez puts him in only for Blackman to make a good save with his legs, while the Foxes have Maguire to thank for preventing Stevens from finding the net with a good block at the other end. 

Still 0-0...

#LeiShu https://t.co/I693rXpdEI
#lcfc getting closer... Both Ndidi and Iborra force good saves from Blackman while Iheanacho also sees an effort blocked. City in control, but still level after 2️⃣5️⃣ minutes.

Listen live 📻 https://t.co/B8Xfnn41jH

#LeiShu https://t.co/37xosFYboV
A whisker wide from Vardy, who attempts to guide the ball into the far corner after good work on the counter from Gray. Leicester looking very lively on the break, but still goalless. #LeiShu
Competitive opening 🔟 minutes here as the first chance of the evening falls to Vardy. It's a good first touch from Ndidi's pass but a deflection on his shot takes the ball just over the bar. #LeiShu
It's a 4️⃣4️⃣2️⃣ for the Foxes. Gray wide left 👈, Mahrez right 👉, Iheanacho up top with Vardy 👆 and the skipper Morgan back in the heart of defence 💙. #LeiShu
It's @EmiratesFACup time 🏆😁

The Foxes against The Blades with a spot in the quarter-finals at stake!

Claude Puel says the timing of Man City's first two goals made it tough for his side - https://t.co/GRQzP6K93d #MciLei https://t.co/45ykKGEfuq
Read our verdict following #MciLei 👇

https://t.co/W7IfEomvZp
CLAUDE: “It’s important for us to clear our minds now, to look forward and prepare for the next game with consistency and confidence.” #MciLei
CLAUDE: “We changed the team at half-time because I wanted to give us greater possibility to recover the ball and to create chances on the counter attack. But when we conceded so quickly it was difficult to come back.” #MciLei
CLAUDE: “We were in a good position at half-time, but the timing of their second goal was important and they were able to kill the game. We needed to resist and try to cause problems when we recovered the ball.” #MciLei
CLAUDE: “First half was good, but we conceded at bad times and it changed the nature of the game. It was difficult after that. To concede five was harsh for us, but we played against a great team.” #MciLei
LCFC Radio summariser, @Gerry_Taggart gives his full-time verdict on #MciLei 📻 ⬇️ https://t.co/pcpXNPZEPZ
Full-time at Etihad Stadium. Manchester City 5-1 Leicester City #MciLei https://t.co/iW4R9PT69J
Goal. Agüero rattles in his fourth of the game. In off the underside of the crossbar from 25 yards.

5️⃣-1️⃣

#MciLei
Goal. Agüero completes his hat-trick with a lofted finish over Schmeichel after picking up a loose pass. 

4️⃣-1️⃣

#MciLei
Mazy run by Mahrez comes to an end with a foul by Gundogan. Albrighton finds Maguire with the resulting free kick but the defender can only find the side netting with his effort. 

There are 1️⃣5️⃣ minutes remaining, with the hosts 3️⃣-1️⃣ up.

#MciLei
Vardy runs into space and picks out Mahrez, who plays a clever first-time pass to James, but he can't quite control it. Man City still dominating the possession, but #lcfc remain a threat. #MciLei
Double change...

▶️ Mahrez
▶️ Iheanacho
◀️ Diabaté
◀️ Chilwell

Looks like a 4-4-1-1, with Mahrez right and Iheanacho in behind Vardy.

#MciLei
.@F_diabate33 drives forward as the Foxes look to get going in the second half. #MciLei https://t.co/ly8N7lqSG1
Goal. Agüero squeezes a finish beyond Schmeichel from another De Bruyne pass. 

3️⃣-1️⃣

#MciLei
Goal. Man City go back ahead as Agüero finishes from De Bruyne's cross.

2️⃣-1️⃣

Marc Albrighton finds space to bring the ball out from the back and launch another attack for #lcfc. #MciLei https://t.co/HsnQblmlqF
Little bit of work for Schmeichel to do now as Man City look to respond  quickly to Vardy's goal. The Dane saves well from Bernardo Silva and  Fernandinho, with the hosts looking very dangerous in attack. 

📻 https://t.co/5ZY6apNgSJ

#MciLei https://t.co/9GxUpsObQd
All square at Etihad Stadium. @vardy7's fifth goal in as many games against the hosts makes it 1-1. #MciLei https://t.co/I62Y9XvSpj
GOALLLLLLLL! JAMIE VARDY LEVELS! YASSSSSS 😁

Loose ball. Vardy motors past three defenders. Finds the bottom corner.

1️⃣-1️⃣

#MciLei https://t.co/FGwVxPkHgN
#mcfc clinical in the opening 20 minutes and seeing plenty of the ball. #lcfc's main outlet has been Vardy's pace in behind, but they've not been able to test the goalkeeper yet.

The Foxes are doing their best to respond on the counter amid heavy pressure from the hosts, but Man City 'keeper Ederson is alert to the threat so far. #MciLei

Barnes, Martis, Knight, Eppiah... the #lcfcu23s are creating chances, but they are just not going in! Still 1-0 to Pompey.
Goal. Pompey take the lead as Maloney picks his spot into the bottom corner. The #lcfcu23s trail 1-0 in the #PLCup.
This is a lot more like the #lcfcu23s we've seen all season as Barnes and then Eppiah force Bass into a fine double save! 💪 Still 0-0.
The #lcfcu23s are much improved since the restart with Barnes and Martis having attempts at the Pompey goal. Still awaiting a breakthrough...

Still goalless at Nyewood Lane... 🔒🚫 #lcfcu23s https://t.co/3sU1voWb4d
Choudhury! 😬 Barnes drags it back for the #lcfcu23s skipper in the middle. Pompey stopper Bass saves well. Better from City! 👏
It falls for Whatmough on the edge of City's area. The Portsmouth man, though, arrows it over. Smith then heads over for Pompey.

The #lcfcu23s survive and it remains 0-0.
It's been tight so far with City playing some nice stuff. However, they've not been able to carve Pompey open just yet. #lcfcu23s
Widdrington and Lethbridge have gone close for Pompey, but neither tested #lcfcu23s stopper Bramley. 0-0 in Bognor Regis.
We're underway at Nyewood Lane as the #lcfcu23s face Portsmouth hoping to go seven points clear at the top of Group F in the #PLCup.

CLAUDE: “It’s a pity to concede another goal from a set play. We have to work to correct this, to be stronger in our duels.” #LeiSwa
CLAUDE: “It’s harsh on my players because we deserved more. Swansea played with quality second half. We finished strongly, but without the result at the end. It feels like we lost two points.” #LeiSwa
CLAUDE: “Frustration is the right word. We played well against a tough team that made it difficult to find space, but we needed to score more first half. Swansea had one chance and they scored.” #LeiSwa

Ndidi lofts a beautiful finish over the goalkeeper and the Foxes think they have a 2-0 lead, only for the offside flag to rule it out. #LeiSwa
How did that stay out?!

Diabaté races through and forces a brilliant save from Fabianski then Mawson somehow blocks Iheanacho's follow up on the line! Still 1-0, Foxes on top.

#LeiSwa
Vardy, one-nil.

Plenty of possession for the Foxes in the opening stages but no breakthrough, as Vardy forces a good save from Fabianski, only for the flag to go up for offside. He's linking up well with Iheanacho so far. #LeiSwa

Our take on the #lcfcu23s first #PL2 loss since September 👇

https://t.co/fMdpfFxK7M
A frustrating night for City's youngsters... #lcfcu23s https://t.co/S260VASrWX
Eppiah's low shot is cleared off the line! The #lcfcu23s are giving it their all out there, but Chelsea are frustrating them... 😞
The #lcfcu23s' final sub sees Dewsbury-Hall take Kaba Sherif's place on the pitch with five minutes to go. Come on, City!
Martis comes on in a like-for-like swap with Wright on the flanks. Still plenty of time for the #lcfcu23s to get back into this one! 💪
A first change of the night for the #lcfcu23s...

▶️ Ndukwu
◀️ Gordon

Just over 2️⃣0️⃣ minutes to get back in this one in Aldershot... ⏰
Wood's free-kick lands on the head of Hughes in the box, but the #lcfcu23s defender's header lacks enough power to worry Bulka.
Goal. The hosts take the lead as Redan turns inside the box and smashes it beyond Iversen into the Foxes net.

Chelsea 1️⃣-0️⃣ #lcfcu23s.
An early scare for the #lcfcu23s 😅

James forces Iversen into a smart stop before Hughes gets in before Redan to concede a corner...
- 1️⃣1️⃣ shots
- 3️⃣ corners
- 4️⃣7️⃣% possession

...but 0️⃣ goals so far for #lcfcu23s.

The second half is underway at Chelsea. Come on, City! 👏
Plenty of chances for the #lcfcu23s so far... https://t.co/tpAUTbnH6F
Barnes crosses for Wright to unleash a fearsome drive on the half-volley, but Bulka makes a spectacular save! ⚽👐

Everything but a goal for the #lcfcu23s at Chelsea... 👏
Choudhury from 40 yards! 😱 The #lcfcu23s skipper catches Bulka off his line and goes for it! 

Luckily for Chelsea, Bulka tips it onto the bar.
Wright tries to locate the top corner of Bulka's goal for the Foxes, but his effort glides over the bar.

Chelsea 0️⃣-0️⃣ #lcfcu23s, 3️⃣2️⃣ mins.
After a smart cross from Kaba Sherif, Gordon rattles the base of Chelsea's post! An inch to the left and City would be ahead... 🔬😬

So, so close for the #lcfcu23s!
Two superb deliveries from Wood give Hughes and then Johnson opportunities to head the Foxes ahead. 

Both denied ❌

The #lcfcu23s are looking 👌 at EBB Stadium! 👏
Gordon takes aim from outside the box, but his curler is too high. At the other end, St Clair tests Iversen in the Foxes net. 

Chelsea 0️⃣-0️⃣ #lcfcu23s 👍
Kick-off in Aldershot! 🔵⚫️

The #lcfcu23s can go level on points with Liverpool at the #PL2 summit with a victory over Chelsea this evening... 🤞

Full-time at ABAX Stadium, Peterborough United 1-5 Leicester City #PetLei https://t.co/v3al3kGV1x
GOAL! NDIDI MAKES IT FIVE FOR THE FOXES!

Diabate's brilliant run tees him up. Emphatic finish. 

5️⃣-1️⃣

#PetLei https://t.co/qDvRJvfy7S
GOALLLL! DIABATÉ GETS HIS SECOND OF THE MATCH! ⚽️⚽️

Gray's mazy run ends with a shot that's saved into Diabaté's path. Nice finish into the top corner 😎

It's 4️⃣-1️⃣ to the Foxes! 

#PetLei https://t.co/4AOxoTt51x
Gray, Albrighton, Ndidi, Iheanacho, Diabaté.... the chances are coming but #lcfc just can't quite find the fourth as Chilwell enters the game to replace Iheanacho.

Listen live: https://t.co/FmVxquGsm7

#PetLei https://t.co/m0TFPOAeUN
The Foxes settling into their stride again now. Only a fine stop from Bond denied Diabaté an excellent second goal while Gray is getting closer and closer. #PetLei
Gray opens up the space for another great Fuchs ball into the box, which Iheanacho is agonisingly close to converting. 

First two changes follow...

▶️ Ndidi
▶️ Albrighton
◀️ Iborra
◀️ Barnes

#PetLei
Goal. The hosts pull a goal back after a set play. Andrew Hughes the man with the finish beyond Hamer.

1️⃣-3️⃣

#PetLei
Foxes forward @22Demarai finds space to turn in the midfield and drive at the Posh defence. #PetLei https://t.co/HkJ033HetN
Peterborough much-improved after the break but are yet to really test Hamer, as the goalkeeper does well to read Maddison's low cross into the box and gather. #PetLei
#lcfc midfielder @adrien_silva23 goes head-to-head with Peterborough's Leo Da Silva Lopes to win possession for the Foxes. #PetLei https://t.co/g0xJpgi1UH
Back underway with the Foxes sitting on a healthy 3️⃣-0️⃣ lead after goals from Fousseni Diabaté ⚽️ and Kelechi Iheanacho ⚽️⚽️

Listen live to the second half: https://t.co/FmVxquGsm7

#PetLei https://t.co/a9Fhm2KgkI
Half-time score form ABAX Stadium. Peterborough United 0-3 Leicester City #PetLei https://t.co/hX5rLzxk4i
.@adrien_silva23 congratulates @67Kelechi after the Nigerian's second goal of the game at ABAX Stadium. 3-0 to the Foxes. #PetLei https://t.co/97ErySQluJ
Confidence really flowing for #lcfc now, as are the chances. 

Iheanacho comes within a whisker of a hat-trick, but fires just over while Diabaté sends another effort wide.

Just over 🔟 minutes left in the half, #lcfc 3️⃣-0️⃣ up.

#PetLei
BRILLIANT GOAL! IT'S IHEANACHO AGAIN! ⚽️⚽️

Beauty of a cross by Fuchs and there's Iheanacho to meet it with a right foot volley.

3️⃣-0️⃣ to us 😁

#PetLei https://t.co/4ilxJvCZv5
3️⃣ goals in 2️⃣ Emirates FA Cup games for @67Kelechi! 🔥

#PetLei https://t.co/4KGAAUMvgu
Excellent opening 2️⃣0️⃣ from #lcfc. The front four looking extremely dangerous as they push hard for a third goal to add to the strikes from Diabaté and Iheanacho.

👂📻 Have a listen: https://t.co/FmVxquGsm7

#PetLei https://t.co/4hl1URPGpe
Debut goal! Fousseni Diabaté is congratulated by his #lcfc colleagues after opening the scoring during #PetLei... 🙌 https://t.co/LJsLXfn47N
GOALLLLL! IHEANACHO MAKES IT 0️⃣-2️⃣!

On the counter, excellent left foot finish into the bottom corner from 20 yards. Love it!

#PetLei https://t.co/QkzIcG5EAx
GOALLLLL! IT'S A DEBUT STRIKE FOR DIABATÉ 🙌⚽️

Silva's pass. Brilliant first touch. Left foot finish across the 'keeper into the bottom corner.

0️⃣-1️⃣

#PetLei https://t.co/xrOBSWqvzg
Foxes on the front foot early here at Abax Stadium, with Diabaté rattling a left foot shot over while Iheancho's clever turn and shot forced a good save. Lively start. #PetLei
Looks to be a 4-2-3-1 for the Foxes, with Gray wide left, Diabaté wide right and a central role for Academy graduate Barnes, who sees a flicked effort just wide inside 60 seconds. #PetLei
It's FA Cup time! ⚽️

Our take on the action from tonight's clash at the Stadium of Light 👇

https://t.co/AZxRbN5VtO
A disappointing night for the #lcfcu23s... https://t.co/hps9KdygDL
Martis shows exceptional pace to gallop through Sunderland's backline. He's denied by Stryjek, though... 😞 Three minutes added on.
The #lcfcu23s make another change in the North East... 

▶️ Martis
◀️ Gordon

Just over 10 minutes to go.
City's youngsters are still pushing at the Stadium of Light, but the Black Cats are standing tall and frustrating them in the final third...
This is a lot more like it from the #lcfcu23s! Ndukwu goes close from four yards before a trialist, on for Thomas, rattles the post from inside the area.
City have made an encouraging start in the second half at the Stadium of Light with Thomas, Ndukwu, Gordon and Eppiah all looking a threat...

Sunderland 2️⃣-0️⃣ #lcfcu23s.
The #lcfcu23s get the second half underway. Currently 2-0 down, they need at least a draw to be sure of progression in the #PLInternationalCup.
A big second half performance needed... https://t.co/Oiv3ahbLkS
The hosts make it 2-0 as Embleton curls a wonderful effort into the far corner from the right wing. Work to be done by the #lcfcu23s.
Goal. Connelly capitalises on an awkward bounce at the back to slot it beyond Iversen in the #lcfcu23s net. Sunderland lead.
Lovely skills from Gordon on the left wing to evade his marker, but Stryjek races out to collect his pass to Thomas. Almost! 😬

Sunderland 0️⃣-0️⃣ #lcfcu23s midway through the first half.
The #lcfcu23s go close at the Stadium of Light as Thomas glances Ndukwu's smart corner towards goal, but Stryjek holds it. 

Nice stuff from City! 💪
Just the one clear opening for the Foxes so far as Gordon curls it high and wide of Stryjek in the Sunderland net. #lcfcu23s
Our final #PLInternationalCup group fixture is underway!

The #lcfcu23s are top of Group B, level on four points with Sunderland.

Riyad makes it 2-0. Pass from Silva, left foot, tight angle! YES!

#LeiWat https://t.co/IlPTyduMQU
Watford throwing men forward here with just one goal in it, but the Foxes are looking dangerous on the counter. Just five minutes left. COME ON!

#LeiWat https://t.co/8NLcwBC5UR
Magnificent one-on-one save by Schmeichel denies Watford sub Gray an equaliser!

Listen to the last 15 minutes live: https://t.co/ngn98VnRCq

#LeiWat https://t.co/QwEy90r6Wm
Mahrez causing real problems for Watford now as gaps begin to appear. He slides Vardy in one-on-one, but up goes the offside flag. Close one! Still 1️⃣-0️⃣ to #lcfc. #LeiWat
First Foxes change...

▶️ Gray
◀️ Okazaki

Big round of applause for Shinji. Superb, as always. 

#LeiWat
Lots more space for #lcfc to attack this half. Even Maguire has had a couple of mazy runs - the latest almost leading to a tap-in for Vardy. Well defended by Watford though. #LeiWat https://t.co/oWMpuflBZo
Bright start to the second half as Vardy nips in behind and pulls the ball back for an Okazaki effort. He hits it first time but Karnezis gets down well to save. #LeiWat https://t.co/SKvBXgKiqa
Back underway in the second half, where the Foxes have their noses in front thanks to a Jamie Vardy penalty.

COME ON!

#LeiWat https://t.co/6SfbGDGBdU
Half-time: Leicester City 1️⃣-0️⃣ Watford

Jamie Vardy's penalty the difference after 45 minutes.

GOALLLLLLLL! JAMIE VARDY ⚽️

Sends the 'keeper the wrong way from the spot 😎

1️⃣-0️⃣

#LeiWat https://t.co/eVm5Uf5krj
Penalty to #lcfc...

Vardy fouled by Wagué in the box. 

#LeiWat
Frustration for the Foxes as the Watford back line is proving difficult to break down after 30 minutes at King Power Stadium. Vardy has got in behind a couple of times but the Hornets have recovered well. #LeiWat https://t.co/U69CXJ7LKo
No goals, 2️⃣0️⃣ minutes played, but plenty of positive play from the Foxes. Vardy and Ndidi have had the best chances so far, though Watford look a threat.

#LeiWat https://t.co/6nR6Yqi0IG
#lcfc spring into life. First Vardy is found over the top. He out-muscles Wagué but can't bat Karnezis with his shot before Ndidi sees one blocked on the line after a free kick. Close! #LeiWat
Watford putting the Foxes under a little pressure in the early stages here as they force three corners, but Schmeichel very nearly turns the third into a counter for #lcfc. #LeiWat

The #lcfc Development Squad's 19-game unbeaten run comes to an end... https://t.co/iZyJpqJ7Ba
City are still battling away as the fourth official indicates a minimum of four minutes added time will be played. https://t.co/nEkE40jI4U
Goal. It's 4-2 to Oldham as Pringle's free-kick is nodded into the net by Obadeyi. Nothing Hamer could do.
Dewsbury-Hall makes way to be replaced by Eppiah. Less than 10 minutes to go - and City need a goal.
Goal. The Latics regain their lead as captain Gerrard tucks it into the bottom corner of Hamer's net. 3-2.
All to play for in the latter stages! https://t.co/K5bXKTHUsZ
Leicester's first change of the night...

▶️ Gordon
◀️ Diabaté

It's 2-2 with just over 20 minutes remaining. https://t.co/d0TuSb8wDt
GOOAALL! The Foxes are level in Oldham! 

A brilliant pass from Dewsbury-Hall finds Barnes. He locates Musa in the middle and the forward slides it into the net. 2-2 at Boundary Park. https://t.co/yS3R9ZsIzv
Barnes seizes possession and strives to get City back into Oldham's half with the visitors seeking an equaliser. https://t.co/UvkKoqjLkc
Goal. Hamer saves a low penalty from Davies, but the Oldham man slots home the rebound. 2-1 to the hosts at Boundary Park.
Penalty to Oldham. The referee adjudges that Wood handled in the area...
Goal. Davies completes a nice move for Oldham by poking it past Hamer and making it 1-1 at Boundary Park.

GOOAALL!! Dewsbury-Hall's long range shot is fumbled by Placide in the Oldham net - and Knight bundles it home! 🙌 https://t.co/RyO6shR8GW
Another uncomfortable moment for the Foxes at the back as Edmundson rattles the post with a smart header from Pringle's cross. 

It remains 0️⃣-0️⃣ at Boundary Park as half-time approaches.
City enjoy a period of pressure with Thomas and Dewsbury-Hall curling corners in from either side. The hosts, though, stand tall.

Barnes, Diabaté and Thomas looking lively for the Foxes... 👌
A real chance for Oldham as Obadeyi aims for the top corner, but Huth is brave and heads it away for Choudhury to clear... 😬 https://t.co/ibzxmPkmyl
Diabaté gets the ball down and looks to get City on the front foot. 

The visitors have been a threat on the break so far, but it remains goalless. https://t.co/VPKKNu7wQO
Lovely skills from Diabaté, deep in his own half, to help the Foxes get it away as Oldham look to open up the defence...

... A few minutes later, Wilson belts it towards Hamer's net, but the City stopper does well to get a 👐 to it...
We're off! Oldham Athletic get us underway at Boundary Park. 90 minutes and penalties if required. Come on, City! 👏

CLAUDE: “I thought the red card for Chilwell was harsh, but we managed the situation well when we had 10 men. The players worked hard to make sure we took a point.” #CheLei
CLAUDE: “We played a fantastic game today. We produced good play, good quality and lots of chances. We built our play with good passing and combinations between our players, so there’s a little disappointment that we didn’t win.” #CheLei
CLAUDE: “In the end I think we deserve another result. We had a lot of chances without a clinical edge or bit of luck and it costs us two points. After the red card, a point is a good reward for the team.” #CheLei
A hard-earned point for #lcfc. 👏

Chance for King to break the deadlock on 75 minutes as #lcfc keep it alive from a set play and tee him up for a left foot shot, but he guides it just wide. #FleLei
Slimani fires into the side netting at the far post after Gray's lofted cross looked for a moment like it might be drifting into the top corner. Close. #FleLei

A couple of bright moments from Fleetwood now. First Silva clears off the line from a Bolger header before Jakupović gets down to save a Hunter shot. Still goalless. #FleLei
First opportunity for the Foxes as a free kick is bent in towards Slimani, but it falls at an awkward height for the striker, who guides his effort wide. #FleLei

Mahrez and Albrighton are giving #lcfc life in wide areas so far as they look to work it for Slimani but its Fuchs who finds him eventually. The offside flag goes up however as Lössl tips the header over. #LeiHud

Who was your man of the match tonight? 🤔

#LeiMun
Foxes. Never. Quit. 

#LeiMun https://t.co/dcW7UDu04E
CLAUDE: “This is a difficult period for the players with so many games, especially after 120 minutes on Tuesday and playing with 10 men today. It’s a crazy period, but we will recover and be ready for Watford.” #LeiMun
CLAUDE: “I think it’s a good present for our fans at the start of the Christmas period. We have come back with confidence after the Crystal Palace game and we’re ready to take it forward.” #LeiMun
MAGUIRE: “It’s one of those results that feels like a win. Crucial we stuck with it with 10 men and Kasper’s saved us a couple of times to keep it at 2-1. Good recovery from last week, so got to kick on.” #LeiMun
CLAUDE: “It’s a good point with 10 men and with the scenario of the game. The players believed until the end that we could come back. There is room for improvement, but it feels like a good point.” #LeiMun

GOALLLLLLLL! HARRY MAGUIREEEEEEEE!

IT'S 2-2 IN STOPPAGE TIME! YASSSSSSS! https://t.co/MTgwyLIniQ
The Foxes throwing everything at Man Utd but leaving themselves open at the back as Rashford goes one-on-one with Schmeichel, but the 'keeper comes out on top. #LeiMun
#lcfc down to 10 men as Amartey is dismissed for a second yellow card after fouling Rashford. #LeiMun
Second change for #lcfc with 25 minutes remaining. 

▶️ Okazaki
◀️ Iborra

#LeiMun
Goal. Mata curls a free kick beyond Schmeichel to put Man Utd 2️⃣-1️⃣ up. #LeiMun
First change for #lcfc is an enforced one as Simpson looks to have picked up a knock.

▶️ Amartey
◀️ Simpson

Still 1️⃣-1️⃣

#LeiMun
Off the line! Mahrez works the ball to the far post where Fuchs arrives and fires a shot that's blocked by Lindelöf on the line. Close! #LeiMun https://t.co/pdu5MwPwXd
Second half, here we go! 

It's 1️⃣-1️⃣ after a highly entertaining first 4️⃣5️⃣ minutes.

Half-time: Leicester City 1-1 Manchester United 

See you in the Match Centre - https://t.co/YeIATX9Qo4

#LeiMun https://t.co/jtfyMlx5qz
Great spell for the Foxes almost ends with a goal as a ball over the top finds Maguire free, but a United player on the line denies him an easy finish. #LeiMun
Goal. Mata drives a shot low into the corner of the net from 12 yards to make it 1️⃣-1️⃣. #LeiMun
@premierleague Ndidi launches a ball up field for Mahrez to chase. He gets there, holds it up and slips in his team-mate Vardy for a beautiful left foot finish into the bottom corner. 

#LeiMun
GOALLLLLLLLLL! 

5️⃣0️⃣ @premierleague goals for JAMIE VARDY! 

Ndidi to Mahrez to Vardy. So much composure. 

1️⃣-0️⃣

#LeiMun https://t.co/gFVxaIVQ88
Gray sees #lcfc's first shot go wide as the Foxes try to limit United's time on the ball, but Lukaku in particular is giving Morgan and Maguire work to do at the back. Still goalless, 1️⃣5️⃣ minutes played.

Iborra glances a beautiful header in the bottom corner from a Mahrez free kick..... but the referee blows for a free kick. #LeiCry https://t.co/95zeaS1M6C
Better. Albrighton to Vardy to Mahrez. The winger has a shot across goal that's well tipped away by Speroni, but unfortunately not into the path of Vardy. Still 2-0 to Palace.

Your #SouLei man of the match? 🤔
CLAUDE: “We want to always improve and make progress. The players are enjoying their football, but it’s important we continue because there are difficult games ahead, starting with Crystal Palace on Saturday.” #SouLei
CLAUDE: “We had to make some changes because it’s a busy period, so it was good to see players like Okazaki and King making a difference. If we can maintain good levels when we make changes, it’s promising for the future.” #SouLei
CLAUDE: “Good night for my team. First half was fantastic and it was important to maintain it in the second. After they scored we recovered very well and secured a good result.” #SouLei

#NewLei
GOALLLLLLLLLL! OKAZAKI MAKES IT 3️⃣-2️⃣!  

(Okay it may have been a Perez og but let's just give it to Shinji and enjoy the moment for now! 😁)  

Vardy did well to stay on his feet and find Okazaki as the ball was bundled home.

Jamie Vardy looks to apply pressure on the Magpies' defence... #NewLei https://t.co/3QJfdXtqWW

#NewLei
Positive response from #lcfc to going behind as Gray, Chilwell, Mahrez and Albrighton all deliver balls into the danger area from wide positions. 

Well defended by the hosts. #NewLei

Your #LeiBur man of the match?
CLAUDE: “We could have been more clinical in the second half and perhaps we would have had more goals, but to win with a clean sheet is always satisfying.” #LeiBur
CLAUDE: “Interesting to see Gray behind the striker as it’s good to have options. His goal will be good for Demarai after an excellent performance from Okazaki against Tottenham.” #LeiBur
CLAUDE: “A good week, of course, but crucial to continue. Difficult game today against a confident team. We saw their strength and quality first half, but I was very happy with our second half performance.” #LeiBur

Full-time: Leicester City 1-0 Burnley

Three points. Chalk 'em up! 

#LeiBur https://t.co/OrE49eWYoi
First change for the Foxes. Huge reception for both players at King Power Stadium 👏

▶️ Okazaki
◀️ Gray

#LeiBur
Gray, Mahrez and Albrighton all giving it 💯 to set up Vardy but it remains 1-0. Chances flowing for the Foxes at the moment though...

https://t.co/zTbnQThOkE

#LeiBur https://t.co/tnqK2zz6Ss
Both 'keepers called into action in the last few minutes. Schmeichel was at his best to deny Hendrick while Pope has kept out both Albrighton and Gray, who also hit the post!  

Still 1️⃣-0️⃣. Listen to the final 2️⃣0️⃣ minutes 👉👂 https://t.co/zTbnQThOkE

#LeiBur https://t.co/ArycXdUCi8
Cheeky little dink by Mahrez to Vardy, whose volley is blocked into the path of Morgan. The ball then bobbles towards the goal line but Burnley clear. Nice from the Foxes! 

Still 1️⃣-0️⃣, with 3️⃣0️⃣ minutes to play. COME ON!

#LeiBur
📸 Bright start to the second half from #lcfc. It's 50-50 in the possession stakes but the Foxes are looking dangerous with Mahrez on the breakaway.

Mahrez 🔥 Clever header from Ndidi tee tee up the break as Mahrez races away from the midfield and forces Pope into an excellent save. Strong finish to the half...

#LeiBur
The game has calmed down a little after an exciting start, but #lcfc's midfield three of Albrighton, Gray and Mahrez are beginning to look more and more dangerous running at the Burnley defence.

🔟 minutes left in the half. https://t.co/HOMfiTAYlR
Gudmundsson brings out a good save from Schmeichel as Burnley press but after 20 minutes, it's still #lcfc on top thanks to Gray getting on the end of a Mahrez cross.

#LeiBur https://t.co/wvGAXxavSF
All hands on deck for #lcfc as Hendrick's cross squirms through and finds former 🦊 Wood, but Schmeichel and Simpson combine to clear the danger. 

#LeiBur
Fresh trim and an assist, @Mahrez22!

👀💇‍♂️⚽️

#LeiBur https://t.co/pCtOb5Q91G
Update: He's okay 👍😁
GOALLLLL! GRAY MAKES IT 1-0 ⚽️🦊

A cross from Mahrez to the back stick, Pope pushes it away, but only as far as Gray, who collides with the post as he finishes. Fingers crossed he's okay.
