Steve Smith: I don't blame anyone. I'm the captain of the Australian team. It's on my watch and I take responsibility for what happened last Saturday.
Steve Smith: Cricket is the greatest sport in the world. It's been my life and I hope it can be again. I'm sorry and I'm absolutely devastated.
Steve Smith: If any good can come of this, if there can be a lesson to others then I hope I can be a force for change. I know I'll regret this for the rest of my life. I'm absolutely gutted. I hope in time I can earn back respect and forgiveness.

After Cameron Bancroft finished taking questions, WACA CEO Christina Matthews confirmed that under current WACA rules he is not permitted to play grade cricket in the state due to his suspension but a rule change is under consideration
The Cameron Bancroft press conference has ended. He has apologised for what he did, said he will let his actions speak for him as 'words don't mean much in these circumstances' and has vowed to regain the respect of the cricket community.
Cameron Bancroft: It's going to be a really long road particularly for myself to earn that respect back but for me that's the most important thing.
Cameron Bancroft: It's so big because the action of doing it is completely wrong. For me to carry that out in front of world cricket and to be seen breaking the laws of the game, not playing within the spirit of the game, it's completely how cricket shouldn't be played.
Cameron Bancroft: I have never ever been involved in tampering with the ball (before now) and it clearly compromises my values and what I stand for as a player and as a person.
Cameron Bancroft: The thing that breaks my heart the most is that I've given up my spot in the team for free. People know I worked so hard to get to this point in my career and to have given up that chance for free is devastating.
Cameron Bancroft: I lied. I lied about the sandpaper. I panicked in that situation and I'm very sorry ... I feel like I've let everyone down in Australia.
Cameron Bancroft: All I can do is ask for forgiveness ... I will do my best to contribute to the community
Cameron Bancroft: I want to say that I'm very sorry ... I'm very disappointed and I regret my actions ... It is something I will regret for the rest of my life.
