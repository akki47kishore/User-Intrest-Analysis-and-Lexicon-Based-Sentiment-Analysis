My guess is plaintiffs lose due to their shaky facts. When persons of color make VRA claims they can't just say a racial group votes for candidate X. They must base the claim on analysis. But in principle VRA could apply to discrimination against Whites
Defendants counter that there is no expert analysis to support the claim Whites prefer Republicans, so therefore they deny the assertion. This could be right. We've estimated White urban voting patterns to be different than suburban/rural patterns https://t.co/4ovfIryLW4 https://t.co/ueg1w8kEkX
The plaintiffs in the case assert that Whites prefer Republican candidates, ergo since they are 48% of the county's citizen voting-age population they must get 2 of 5 seats, rather than the current 1 of 5 https://t.co/S188OElrRz https://t.co/FffMngPbrk

@Tequila0341 We speculate that the media coverage is the driving causal factor, although we did not have the data to measure it. A scandal generates public outrage and attention, while an ideological extremist can quietly cast votes
This is consistent with our research into small donors. An incumbent's scandal generates small donations for their challenger. Interestingly, challengers don't raise small donations from running against ideological extremists, tho https://t.co/U7YFgvywUI

So, an electronic voting cell phone app could be a game changer, starting first with the military and then extending to the general public
Many of our voting innovations have happened first through the military. Mail voting (really proxy voting)? That was to help deployed military vote as early as the Revolutionary War, and was widespread during the Civil War.  State laws first extended absentee voting to military
Some states already have electronic ballot delivery, print out, sign, scan, and return options for military and overseas voters. Alaska offers it for all domestic voters. Pure electronic mobile voting would be a huge next step https://t.co/Vu3AFXjZhu

@_justinlevitt_ @Redistrict No, I mean zero bias. But there can be estimation uncertainty that should be taken into account. And clearly odd number districts can't be perfectly unbiased if the state is politically even
@_justinlevitt_ @Redistrict I generally agree with you about detecting extreme gerrymanders. But detecting gerrymanders is a completely different subject with different assumptions
@Redistrict Well, if that is your criterion (which is not what practitioners do) I'd recommend splitting  wards/precincts along zero population blocks like roads and water
@_justinlevitt_ @Redistrict I'm saying compactness is not constraining on a range of legal plans that cover fair plans (keeping in mind most states don't require compact congressional districts)
@Redistrict Maybe likely has a different meaning for you, and in that case I apologize for setting you up as a straw man, but to me it speaks with too much certainty about a choice that we both know is not a random process, even when supposedly partisan-blind
@Redistrict You're assuming that a "partisan-blind" process results in the average draw from a (really unknown) distribution. And I think this is the basis for my disagreement with you: "likely." You seem to have overconfidence in what will happen, when that may be better expressed by bounds
@Redistrict @ruthgreenwood The last point is the most important. As a legal matter plaintiffs must show compactness is subordinated to illicit criteria. If Reps draw a compact map that gives them +2 seats above fair, or Dems draw +2 seats above fair, they can withstand a challenge since the map is compact
@Redistrict @ruthgreenwood Compact plans (if even required, which in many states is not), provides a bounded constraint covering a fair map. You're arguing you must choose an average plan (assuming there is even an R advantage), I'm arguing you can choose a fair plan. Really any plan in range can be picked
My published research in OH (peer-reviewed) and VA (a non-peer reviewed law review) comes to similar conclusions in these states, too, that is is possible to have compact and fair congressional redistricting plans
Indeed, Chen similarly produced a report for the FL plaintiffs with a similar finding, that a fair compact FL plan was within the bounds of what was possible https://t.co/jKkMpqZKyT
The 500 PA compact congressional plan simulations Chen produced may not be instructive of the true distribution of redistricting plans, but they do illustrate that when one looks at the problem from feasible bounds, a fair map is within the range of what is possible
Chen, who's original paper on geographic bias fueled a lot of the popular belief in it, wrote an expert report for the PA plaintiffs, showing geographic bias + compactness was not constraining on a fair PA map https://t.co/4Z8VsDxjz7 https://t.co/fMWspeWtCl
@Redistrict I'm not saying split census blocks, I'm saying split precincts/wards. As you are probably well aware since you are an expert on these matters, WI short circuited their normal process of drawing wards before redistricting to do it after for the express purpose of splitting wards
@Redistrict You were certainly out there with your map predicting what the PA court would do, and I warned at the time we can't know what the court would do from the evidence of one map
If we think about what is feasible in terms of permissible bounds rather than averages, then the FL and PA court decisions (both considered compactness among their criteria), show that geography is not as constraining on fair congressional redistricting as it is made out to be
The fallacy of this thinking is exposed in Pennsylvania (and Florida). @Redistrict was certain the PA Supreme Court couldn't produce a fair map, yet they and the FL Supreme Court did by choosing the fair map falling in the range of plans permissible under the state constitution
But this is the next odd bit of logic from @redistrict: a purely non-partisan approach would somehow pick the average redistricting plan that has his supposed pro Republican geographic partisan bias baked into it. Why would the average plan have to be picked?
We actually have no way to know what the distribution of redistricting plans really looks like since redistricting an extremely hard partitioning problem of staggering size
Second, @redistrict assumes the distribution of redistricting plans on partisanship is symmetric, i.e., if it were possible to draw 6/8 Republican +7 districts in WI, but only 4/8 +7 Democratic districts, the distribution must be symmetric with a mean 5/8 districts as Rep leaning
First, @redistrict sets up compactness as a false constraint. The state constitution requires compactness for state legislative districts, but like many state constitutions is silent on congressional redistricting https://t.co/3EnUYLAWPD
@TheoLandsman @Redistrict The offer wasn't constrained by software
Let me address this claim from @redistrct, from the perspective of someone who has 30 years of practical redistricting experience as is among the academics who study redistricting that he disagrees with https://t.co/lDm53KYqkj
This map is constrained because it doesn't split wards/precincts (created with Dave's Redistricting App?). There's $7,000 from @redistrict if you have the time and software to draw map out of census blocks (which is how redistricting actually works) https://t.co/jO6fBw3LKK

@juliapollak1 First, I have never taken an opinion about a gun question on a CDC *survey*. 2nd, there are other sources of data, administrative records and other surveys like the ACS, that estimate the number of noncitizens. The decennial enumeration isn't necessary to collect this information
I like to think of the Maryland gerrymandering case, Benisek, as the little case that could. Unlike the Wisconsin case with its ballyhooed efficiency gap, it doesn't have lots of outside advocacy money promoting it, so it hasn't gotten much press https://t.co/mW8qm3l2jM
The Census Bureau operates carefully when it comes to changing the decennial census or any of the numerous surveys. They field test changes to estimate effects. Sec. Ross made a decision without any such testing. Claiming "no evidence" there will be ill effects is like ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø https://t.co/xBavTVgizf
Hopefully groups can educate communities how the Census Bureau operates in strict confidentiality and will not allow citizenship status to be released outside the Bureau. Yes, a law could be passed to change that, but would require 3/5th majority to overcome the Senate filibuster
Please stop. You also incorrectly predicted the Pennsylvania court couldn't draw a fair map on the basis of the map you drew. Why? Redistricting is such a complicated partitioning problem that no one knows what is possible https://t.co/wK4xqrYE7D
Corporations and government will underestimate population growth in noncitizen communties. Fewer private and public services will be deployed, leading to fewer opportunities (creating an environment for more crime), less education (creating more poverty for citizen children), etc
E.g., because the denominator of the disease rate is incorrect, government might rush aid to an affected noncitizen community that has an artificially high rate due to fewer census responses, thereby wasting resources while the real outbreak in a citizen community is ignored
Some non-political uses for census data that are put at risk:
-identifying disease outbreaks
-knowing where best to allocate police force
-knowing where to locate a new business in a growing population area
and so on...
While Republicans may seek to reap political benefits from an undercount of noncitizen populations, this is a short term political gain for long term public policy harm
Likely the field interviewers will meet resistance in some communities, and Census has limited funds to do follow up interviews. So while the cost run ups will meet some ceiling of available funds, thereby undercounting noncitizen communities
But, the Census Bureau is obligated to enumerate the entire population, so the first consequence will be that the Census Bureau will have to deploy more field interviewers to affected communities, thus increasing the cost of the Census
The decision to add a citizenship question is obviously about political power. Trump is counting on noncitizens to refuse to answer the census, thus affecting apportionment of congressional seats to states and block grant formulas of federal money to states and localites

An effort independent from the campaigns and political parties to collect voter file administrative data would be in a position to share data with the Census Bureau, reducing their costs by millions by helping identify which homes are occupied but did not respond to the Census
With $1 million we could set up an application to passively monitor election management systems in every state for malicious changes to the voter registration data through 2018 (a fourth of that is just to obtain Alabama's outrageously priced voter file monthly)
@BBKogan With $1 million we could set up an application to passively monitor election management systems in every state for malicious changes to the voter registration data before 2018 (a fourth of that is just to obtain Alabama's outrageously priced voter file monthly)
While the $380 million in election security funding is welcome, the reality is that it will have little effect on the 2018 election. The money will need to be allocated to the states, states will have to assess their needs given available funds, and software solutions programmed

Since most votes were cast on no-paper trail machines to have any hope of reversing Lamb's lead Saccone needed a series of tabulation errors, all in his favor. We would know by now if such errors exist. Recounting paper ballots will not reverse Lamb's 712 margin; could add to it

Voters have 7 days to cure provisional ballots and overseas/military ballots postmarked yesterday have 7 days to arrive at election offices. These ballots should break Lamb (more heavy Dem overseas than military). So, we probably won't have the near-final count until next Tuesday
Barring a monumental and improbable chain of election official tabulation errors, Lamb won #PA18. Given how close the election is, out of respect for the candidates and the voters we should still wait for election officials to double-check everything and certify the results
In a recount, only paper absentee and provisional ballots can be recounted. There are a relatively small number of these ballots, so there is no way Saccone can make up deficit by recounting these ballots. Indeed, past history of such recounts suggests Lamb would net votes
By tabulation screw-ups I mean election officials forgot to put a voting machine memory card in a tabulation device or ran same memory card twice. Such errors have happened in isolation in past. Netting 642 votes, requires this to happen more than once, all in Saccone's favor
#PA18 next steps:

-Lamb has +641 lead
-Next 7 days late arriving overseas/military and provisional ballots counted, likely break Lamb
-Election officials check results/recounts requested of voting machines with no paper trails

Saccone wins only on multiple tabulation screw-ups

Absentee shift will likely help Lamb https://t.co/Wv5DllsCEr
RT @jamiedupree: Absentees have been counted now in Allegheny County, and gave Lamb a boost of about 700+ votes
So, I *think* Lamb squeaks out a win given the Election Day vote (2 Westmoreland precincts left to report and Lamb leading by 95 votes). The absentees and provisional ballots will likely break slightly to Lamb. Can't know for sure until all votes counted, and could go to recount
@historyapollo You can delve into the spreadsheet if you wish to do so. The bottom line is the absentees should break towards Lamb across the board. If Lamb holds a lead once the Election Day vote is counted, he likely wins
While PA uses touch machines with no paper trail for Election Day votes, the absentee and provisional ballots are paper and can be recounted if county election boards vote to do so
It could be that Lamb will pick up some votes in the absentees. Also keep in mind, there are late arriving overseas ballots and provisional ballots, too, that should break for Lamb
In Allegheny County in the 2016 election, Clinton won the Election Day vote 55.7% to 39.7%; won the absentee vote by a larger margin, 59.7% to 35.2% (the spreadsheet is in available through this link) https://t.co/gWxh07QNov
How will the #PA18 absentee ballots break? In Westmoreland County in the 2016 presidential election, Trump won the Election Day vote 63.9% to 32.2%; won the absentee vote by a narrower margin, 55.8% to 38.8% https://t.co/7cNjtMJdw8
@chrisgeidner 3 voters in a precinct (aka election district) can request a recount of their no paper trail machines. County election boards can order a recount, too, which may be more relevant for absentee and provisional paper ballots
NOOOOOOO! https://t.co/bLnTB0ujqP
@Redistrict PA also allows overseas ballots to arrive late, if it really comes down to the wire
So if #PA18 goes down to the thin wire as it appears, even a recount of a small number of paper ballots could still determine the outcome of the election
In addition in domestic absentee votes to be counted, there will be likely be some small number of provisional ballots and the late arriving overseas ballots. Both of these will likely break toward Lamb.

But here's the rub: PA uses touch screen voting machines with no paper trail. The only thing you can recount is the absentee paper ballots (and check the tallies of the machines were downloaded correctly) https://t.co/L6RSunD5rC

As #PA18 goes down to the wire, do we know if the absentee vote is included in the tallies so far? Westmoreland reports ZERO absentee, but other counties unclear. Absentee voting is excuse required in PA. Will be mid single-digits of vote and I imagine will break Saccone
@jakewertz I believe so, but I don't have an image of the ballot style. In the old days following the adoption of the secret ballot, the party bloc option came with party emblems to assist illiterate people make their choices
@jakewertz In Greene County, no
There is a freebie research project here. I'd suggest running a lab experiment to back up the empirical data
If you identify with the Republican Party, but want to defect from the party on this one candidate, makes sense you'd avoid the straight party Dem option and vote for the Dem candidate directly
With 100% of Greene reporting: the straight party vs. candidate vote

Straight Party
Dem 39.8%
Rep 59.4%

Candidate
Lamb 42.0%
Saccone 56.9%

This is suggestive that for self-id Reps who cross-over voted, they voted Lamb more often than selecting straight party Dem option
So, while turnout between Dems and Reps will undoubtedly be a big part of the story, perhaps the straight party voting can inform us in real time about cross-over voting/persuasion
Similar straight party vs. candidate voting in Allegheny. The county reports combined straight party and candidate votes for the election results, along with straight party percentages. Can infer Lamb gets greater share of candidate votes than straight party votes https://t.co/udm8zGsN72
@US_Vote It's a ballot choice, not a party registration choice
FWIW, the Allegheny county election website is running a little ahead of the NYT scraping, for those who absolutely need to get their results first https://t.co/gpXmMMQitU
There's little research on the subject, but one might suppose a self-id Republican would decide to vote for Lamb rather than vote a straight Democrat ballot if the voter wanted to cross over

@gelliottmorris TX Dem primary turnout up from 2014 it a small piece of the "Trump is mobilizing Dems" picture, but Dem primaries are within-party contests where Trump is not in the choice set. I haven't changed my priors about PA-18 based on TX primary turnout
@gelliottmorris This really isn't surprising. The studies that attempt to predict general election outcomes from primary elections (usually framed in terms of damaging within-party battles) are inconclusive. Primaries are idiosyncratic.

@profmichelson @ValisJason @BrendanNyhan @AlbertsonB2 No. This is all my personal experience back in the day when academia highly frowned upon practical work. It was one of the reasons why I had such a bad time on the job market. People didn't think I was a serious scholar, so I downplayed my consulting work
@ValisJason @BrendanNyhan @profmichelson @AlbertsonB2 I helped develop and deploy one of the first microtargeting programs used in the country. We won the pivotal Assembly race in 1996, and in 1998 it was used in 14 targeted races, which the Democrats won 13
@ValisJason @BrendanNyhan @profmichelson @AlbertsonB2 Now, if you want to know *why* Democrats came to dominate California politics in the state legislature, its not a mystery to me.

@maestro876 The academic studies are inconclusive. Primaries are fairly random affairs. I'd place more weight on the general election data, which I've found to be a fairly reliable predictor of election outcomes in states with high volumes of early voting
I'll play my broken record now and say likely voter models that rely on past vote history are probably not good predictors of what will happen in 2018
These are primary, not general election statistics, so I wouldn't read too much into them, yet. Still, they are consistent with the general enthusiasm gaps we've seen in special elections and last year's VA and NJ state elections

@PoliticsWolf @peterwattson You need the two &gt;50% BVAP districts to establish the VRA Sec 2 claim, but you can draw the districts to be less than 50% BVAP if they are effective at electing the minority candidate of choice
@PoliticsWolf @peterwattson In Bartlett plaintiffs could not produce a &gt;50% BVAP district without shredding the NC's mandated criteria. 2 questions: 
Are the PA Supreme Court's criteria applicable here? 
If not, there could be a claim VRA Sec 2, but the *remedy* does not need to be two &gt;50% BVAP districts
Head fake! https://t.co/2N1VEOrXzt
@PoliticsWolf @peterwattson Democrats strongly prefer having VRA Sec 2 claims with less than 50% minority VAP. This would open a floodgate of litigation across the country to create many more Democratic leaning minority districts. This won't happen because #SCOTUS understands the national implications
@PoliticsWolf @peterwattson In the Bartlett decision #SCOTUS said that to have a VRA Sec 2 claim, you MUST be able to draw a &gt;50% Black VAP district (not CVAP), following the state's laws. If it is impossible to draw two &gt;50% Black VAP districts then there is no VRA Sec 2 claim
@PoliticsWolf @peterwattson If you can't even create a second 50% Black VAP district, then there is no VRA Sec 2 claim

@market4neolib As you say, the question is complicated, and I agree. And I'm talking about the state Senate case, not the congressional case, btw. As Scalia wrote... https://t.co/T1zTWwNzl6
@market4neolib Of course there is race-based voting. The VRA Sec 2 legal question is can the Afr-Am community elect a candidate of their choice, specifically within PA-02? They are able to do so, with clear cross-over voting by Hispanics and Whites, so the evidence is weak
@market4neolib FYI Scalia's opinion on the remand specifically mentions the lower court following precinct boundaries in their map (although it is clear this isn't the only issue he has with the court's plan) https://t.co/LVp1yeEvzX https://t.co/mqIL2bQKU9
@market4neolib Yes, I agree. I thought the issue was aligning precincts to districts outside of the affected VRA districts
@imillhiser @rickhasen And we're talking about a 3-judge panel
@imillhiser @rickhasen No, this claim involves evidence that needs to be gathered by a lower court
@rickhasen @imillhiser Remember when #SCOTUS slapped down the lower federal court for adjusting TX districts to follow precinct lines, which went beyond addressing the VRA issues?
Let me hazard a guess: NAACP and Common Cause are playing the PA GOP by "thinking" about a lawsuit they never intend to file, freezing them from filing their own lawsuit
So, if the goal isn't to get a new map for 2018, and who knows about 2020, the Afr-Am candidate of choice would have to lose in 2018 and these cases take time to litigate, what is the purpose of the lawsuit?
The best evidence would be if in the upcoming primary or general election the Afr-Am candidate of choice is defeated by white voters voting against the candidate. Even if this occurs, the evidence won't be available until after the 2018 election is over
The evidence is not readily available. We already know the new PA-02 district voted overwhelmingly for Obama and Rep. Brady, with whites joining in coalition with Afr-Am to elect their candidate of choice
Importantly, evidence needs to be compiled. In a similar situation, a federal court rejected Rep. Brown's challenge to the lowering of Black VAP in FL-05 after the FL Supreme Court ordered new congressional districts. The court rejected her claim based solely on lowered Black VAP
I don't understand the end game. A VRA Sec 2 lawsuit would likely not be concluded before 2018, much less 2020. Experts have to write reports, opposing experts write rebuttal reports, depositions taken, and trial, all against the backdrop of likely appeals https://t.co/ahWASNSCt5

While I'm deeply skeptical of automated redistricting, this is the only actual evidence that we have about what a partisan-blind PA congressional map would look like, and results in a fair map
In other words, Chen created a computer algorithm to randomly draw 500 plans according to the court's criteria (compactness and respect for political boundaries).

@A_agadjanian @pollcat No, more records are purged over time, or are transferred within localities in a state, making the matching less reliable. The issue is that voter file list vendors don't actually collect accurate snapshots of the electorate for a past election. It isn't their business model
Just my guess (I have no special insight): @persily will release his own map that incorporates some ideas from the maps submitted to the court, along with his own innovations
Sometime today, expect @persily to release a new PA congressional map in his role of special master for the PA Supreme Court. Less likely, he could decide one of the maps submitted to the court is the "best" map and not release his own recommendation https://t.co/1yTPKKu2DQ
@A_agadjanian @pollcat I think you proved my point. There is virtually no difference for age 60+, all the action happens among lower age groups. If I were to guess why 30-44 have the largest gap, it may be a confluence of over-report bias being greater for self-perceived "voters" and vote validation
@DemocraticLuntz @PoliticsWolf @Elaijuh Depends on the level of white crossover voting. I've seen districts with even less than 40% minority VAP pass VRA Sec 5 muster (back in the day)
@PoliticsWolf @Elaijuh This is no "he said, she said" debate. The U.S. Supreme Court has clearly articulated the standard for VRA Sec 2 compliance is whether or not the minority candidate of choice an be elected, at whatever minority VAP percentage, not if the district has more than 50% minority VAP
@Elaijuh Probably the best parallel: In Florida, a federal court rejected Corrine Brown's lawsuit alleging a violation of VRA Sec 2 when the Black VAP of her district (FL-5) was drawn lower than 50%, at the FL Supreme Court's order
@Elaijuh There is no magic 50% minority VAP threshold for a district to be VRA Sec 2 compliant. The courts have struck down minority opportunity districts drawn (without justification) to magic thresholds in AL, FL, and VA
@Elaijuh As plaintiffs' expert in the VA congressional case that overturned the districts as a racial gerrymander, I can say Scarnati and Turzai's understanding of the VRA is the same willfully ignorant understanding as VA Republicans, resulting in the federal courts voiding their map

@srl To have a VRA Sec. 2 claim, #SCOTUS ruled in Bartlett one must demonstrate it is possible to draw a 50% minority VAP district, but the remedy need not be a 50% district. And one would not have a claim if a district below 50% is electing a candidate of choice
@srl Sec. 2 of the VRA does not say there must be majority-minority districts, rather the minority community is of sufficient size to elect a candidate of their choice. Republicans have repeatedly lost cases (AL, FL, and VA) where they claimed to need meet arbitrary thresholds

The PA Supreme Court didn't provide guidance on how to weigh the non-comparable characteristics of compactness and minimizing boundary splits
Appears while plaintiffs' proposed maps split fewer counties, @GovernorTomWolf's map is slightly more compact on Polsby-Popper and Reock, but less than Plan A on Population Polygon (Grr...Muchin didn't produce averages in her report and there could be rounding error in my calcs)
Check that. It is not clear what the process was that generated @GovernorTomWolf's map. The billions of alternative plans were generated by small changes to a the map using Fifield's et al's MCMC algorithm to test if it is a partisan gerrymander
In the battle of competing computer algorithms, Duchin's billion maps came up with a plan that split 16 counties. Chen's 500 maps came up with two maps that split 15 and 14 counties
Last but not least is the closing act to map-a-palooza, @GovernorTomWolf's map https://t.co/Y8zIqBmOIS
Now, #SCOTUS allows non-minimal population deviations of up to a range of 1 percentage point from largest to smallest district if the state can provide a compelling reason for them. I'd argue deviations are desirable to respect local political boundaries
A potential warning flag is that Dr. Chen did not produce a population deviation report for plaintiffs' two maps. We don't know what to make of this, but it will take some work to run an independent report https://t.co/oUlHhDBAgm

Yeah, maybe the Democrats should have also released an optimal Democratic gerrymander, too, to demonstrate their proposed map was constrained by attempting to comply with the court order. It would have blunted the "Dems gerrymander, too" hottakes https://t.co/WgOieNUNlm
@mdcscry I'd have humans provide some of the starting points, too. Automated redistricting algorithms tend to have demonstrable biases such that they'll gravitate towards certain local optima
@kevin_kelly Fair enough. The court order was more explicit that minimizing boundary splits and increasing compactness were desirable. I agree that in practice leeway should be given to pursue other reasonable goals
Since an integer optimization problem with multiple criteria is so difficult, I envision a future of computer-assisted redistricting where humans draw maps near local optima (which helps narrow the search space), computers seek to improve, and repeat until best plan found
Given the sheer computationally enormous size of the redistricting problem no single person is remotely likely to find the best plan, I expect @persily will be looking to both parties' plans for ideas
These party-drawn maps set a minimal marker that @persily must beat to comply best with the PA constitution, so they are relevant to the discussion https://t.co/Kx0CgprNsj
Again, I ask @GovernorTomWolf to release the computer algorithm-generated map out of millions created that supposedly scored best on the court's criteria

@Nate_Cohn @PoliticsWolf I would assume the Dem plan beats the GOP PA map on the court's stated criteria, else it would be a bad PR move. Would have been nice if the PA GOP plan had the same suite of reports, on the same data, as the Dem plan so we could objectively compare them
@Nate_Cohn @BrianAmos It is here https://t.co/DJOEaFl1PH

@Nate_Cohn @PoliticsWolf To get at that question, perhaps we need @GovernorTomWolf to produce the best computer-generated map. Or maybe not if the algorithm didn't really work as advertised
Also keep in mind this is using 2016 presidential vote, which is probably near the high-water Rep mark in PA

But even if @GovernorTomWolf rejects the GOP leaders' map, the onus shifts to @persily to do at least as well on the court's criteria when drawing his map for the court
Hard to say without actually seeing the GOP leaders' map. My tip-off that @GovernorTomWolf might not agree to the proposal is that they prioritized keeping as many people as possible in their old (unconstitutional) district https://t.co/X7DM4fZk9B
My guess is that if the legislature and governor can agree to adopt a new map by the 15th, and that the map complies with the state constitution, the court will accept the map, even if it doesn't explicitly follow the process proscribed by the court
And here is the GOP leadership's statement re: "submitting" a new congressional map https://t.co/LJUDuHr73Y
So, yeah, this is a SNAFU. "Submit" was used in the court order, "enact" in the opinion. But I'd still point out that the order required the Pennsylvania General Assembly to take the action, not the GOP leadership https://t.co/9NWr27tGwQ https://t.co/MydU1C9oC3
If Alito hadn't dragged his feet in rejecting the legislature's request for a #SCOTUS stay, we might not be in this mess
So, we're not going to get a new PA congressional map adopted today, but GOP legislative leaders hope that they can send a draft map to governor that will satisfy the order order to "submit" a plan h/t @srl https://t.co/9NWr27tGwQ
@Nate_Cohn @GovernorTomWolf The last update to the page was May 8, 2013. I think some things have happened since then meriting new content

Let's assume the GOP legislative leadership will submit a map by midnight. I read the court order to direct the Pennsylvania General Assembly to submit a redistricting plan to @GovernorTomWolf, not the GOP leadership. I think this requires a majority vote of both chambers https://t.co/Yb1sCfS3au
The court ordered the legislature to submit a new plan to @GovernorTomWolf by today and gave the governor until the 15th to decide if he'd accept it. The court would have to issue a new order to change the legislature's responsibility  https://t.co/1rOTSGT7Wb
I've seen this reporting. I expect a legislative vote to adopt a new plan, and that we'd have news about it. I guess the GOP leadership could submit a plan to the Gov without a formal vote, but ultimately a new legislative plan must be enacted as a law https://t.co/BSYe4zEgLp

I'd suggest giving more trust to polls with likely voter screens that rely on self-reported current and prospective engagement than participation in past elections. I'd like more pollsters to report their results under different likely voter models
https://t.co/0wxiXmOmlu
More evidence that likely voters models incorporating past vote history are probably not giving us an accurate read on the 2018 electorate https://t.co/zGOMXzFfMd
We need pollsters to disclose how they calculate likely voters. Some do a great job by providing their numbers under alternative turnout scenarios, but others are a complete black box
Likely voter models based (in part) on participation in the last midterm worked well in 2014 because 2010 was a good Republican year. Likely voter models for 2018 based (in part) on 2014 participation are going to be out of whack
Yeah low turnout in MO special elections probably part of the continuing Democratic over-performance compared to House generic ballot, but keep in mind Dems over-performed AL and VA polling, too. Part of the divergence may be retrospective likely voter models are broken right now
@rickhasen I agree. I appreciate that they wanted to issue the order ASAP to reduce election disruption, but a full opinion should have come by now. Could a dissent be holding it up?

@marywitha4 This is only congressional. There is a separate process that was reformed earlier this decade for state legislative redistricting
The Ohio action could give a lift to reformers in neighboring Michigan https://t.co/KToo8QCNQZ
And of course, the voters must approve the reform. Past experience says that reform is mostly likely to be adopted when there is bipartisan consensus from political leaders, so I think this stands a good chance of being adopted by Ohio's voters
That plan adopted by majority vote would only be good for two elections (assuming it wasn't successfully challenged in court)
The implication is that if bipartisan consensus cannot be reached on a fair plan within the given constraints, then a plan can be adopted by a majority vote with an explicit fairness criterion
The criteria that apply to a bipartisan plan are more complex. They do not include fairness and have threshold requirements on the number of times counties and other political boundaries can be split, as well as compactness
These criteria apply in the event that a bipartisan vote fails and a plan is adopted by a simple majority of the legislature
The criteria appear to place equal weight on fairness through an "not unduly favor" clause, respect local political boundaries, and compactness https://t.co/SBdH8Bl7p2

A minor mystery is why Alito didn't refer the stay decision to the entire #SCOTUS. He didn't need the plaintiff reply's last Friday to know the legislature's request for a stay was weak. His delay may have even led the legislature to make bad decisions https://t.co/22tdBDrjMT

What will @persily do? In my experience it is very difficult to guess what map will be created. Still expect:
-more Democratic leaning districts. Fairness is not a criteria, so may not be equal division of state
-incumbent pairings and open seats
-incumbents with new constituents
As an addendum, everyone engaged in elections can all breathe a sigh of relief that #SCOTUS didn't grant a stay because it would possibly have meant *every* state constitution or ballot initiative that somehow regulates federal elections could be invalidated

Unfortunately, in the early iterations of the contest, political considerations such as political fairness will not be included in the scoring criteria
@mluebbecke @e_d_andersen @JBlevins0 @gurobi @miketrick @mosektw @CoinMP Here is my proposal: I expect at the end of March we will announce a public redistricting competition using a @DistrictBuilder deployment (I'm not in a position to say which state). This would be an ideal opportunity to measure the performance of various optimization algorithms
@mluebbecke @e_d_andersen @JBlevins0 @gurobi @miketrick @mosektw @CoinMP As much as I'd like to say the score components can be weighted into one overall score, the individual components need to be recalculated in each iteration, so this adds computational cost

@mluebbecke @e_d_andersen @JBlevins0 @gurobi @miketrick @mosektw @CoinMP A typical problem: 500,000 units to partitioned into 10 groups, optimized on a score function of seven weighted measurable criteria.

@fivefifths @DistrictBuilder We expect to announce a new redistricting competition near the end of March. Perhaps that would be the right time to talk
@DemocraticLuntz We'll put this all to the test, soon. We expect to announce a redistricting competition at the end of March, where we can then pit man vs. machine
@DemocraticLuntz We've repeatedly demonstrated through our public mapping efforts your don't need a computer algorithm to find a fair plan that balances a multi-criteria scoring function. Algorithms are very challenged to walk and chew gum. People aren't
@DemocraticLuntz So, after creating BARD (where just about every modern automated redistricting algorithm got its inspiration from), we realized humans could cover a greater range of solutions because of how the brain is wired differently than computers
@DemocraticLuntz Because we can't enumerate all redistricting plans, we can't know if a global optimum has been found, so no graph partitioning algorithm can be proved to be unbiased. But, we have demonstrated bias in existing algorithms using toy examples
I encourage you to follow the links if you'd like to know more about the limitations of computers in redistricting https://t.co/JIWejdzFmB
It sounds super sexy to have a super computer draw redistricting plans, but that doesn't solve the intractability of the problem. If every computer in existence could be put to the task of drawing districts, the sun would engulf the Earth before we could enumerate a single state

@JoshuaLivestro I think this is a GOP PA fantasy
If I were the legislature, I'd respond to the second order by asking clarification, thereby delaying the process. Gumming up the process favors Republicans in their quest to delay a new map past 2018
A data annoyance: The first PA court order directed the legislature to minimize ward boundary splits and the second court order asks for precinct boundaries. These are actually two different election units. Precincts usually nest in wards, but need a key to relate the two
While redistricting is one important application demanding boundary info, in another application we've found thousands of voters mis-assigned to districts (as happened in VA HD-28) and are working with election officials to correct these problems
I'd posit that politicians like the lack of transparency in election results (see @openelex effort to overcome this) and in precinct boundaries, since it keeps us, the public, from monitoring them
Ultimately, this is a data collection problem. Some states do a good job by providing a central repository for boundary data, while many do not. A feature that we could add to @DistrictBuilder is a statewide boundary drawing tool to facilitate a central repository
It may be possible that Republican consultants to the legislature have collected these boundaries. I foresee two problems:
1. Consultants are not the legislature, so the order doesn't bind them
2. Can't be assured of the correctness of the boundaries
It may be possible that in preparation for the 2020 census, PA's Census Bureau's liaison has collected local boundaries for inclusion in the next census geography (what is known as Phase 2 of the Redistricting Data Program). The legislature may not have these data
We are digitizing the map images we've collected. Our strategy is to compare the maps to the 2010 census geography and edit as needed. Impossible to complete this project by Wednesday as the court ordered https://t.co/zUnXR0njaa
What about GIS data like that from @DecisionDeskHQ? Well, there are a number of shortcuts taken with those data, such as using 2008 boundaries found in the 2010 census. While some locality boundaries haven't changed, impossible to know for sure unless we can check the current map
In recent months we've contacted PA local election officials for their boundaries. Some have GIS shapefile formats, many have only map images in pdf form, some require use agreements that limit redistribution, some want to sell it, some have not responded
There is no statewide repository for PA ward boundaries. While some states release this information, it is common for states not to have it since they view this information as a local election administration issue
It may be impossible for the PA state legislature to comply with the PA Supreme Court's order for all precinct (aka ward) boundaries https://t.co/bFxCGz5EXO

We argue a solution to gerrymandering is more transparency and public participation. Having more legal maps during the redistricting process helps inform the public policy debate and helps courts hold politicians accountable when they gerrymander https://t.co/NMDs5ma2PU
The 2nd point has to do with the math that @FiveThirtyEight holds so dear. Since the redistricting problem is so complex, the maps produced by one person cannot be guaranteed to be optimal. There almost certainly exist better maps that come to different outcomes and conclusions
Two problems with @Redistrict's approach. 1st, as he is aware, the his plans are not legal. They violate equal population and VRA concerns, and violate additional state constitutional requirements. E.g., FL's fair map adheres to the state constitution https://t.co/AXQF38mS78
Ironically, the approach that @FiveThirtyEight apparently dismisses by saying only math can solve gerrymandering is the same one @Redistrict took: illustrating redistricting trade-offs by having a human hand-draw maps https://t.co/TzuYQRdlKn
Given the limits of computations (i.e., math) to the redistricting problem, we realized humans may be able to provide a greater range of solutions that could inform the policy debate. This led us to create DistrictBuilder (with help from @Azavea) https://t.co/PuEjdYsYUg

This now makes two state courts (PA and FL) that have found partisan gerrymandering violations based on state law. Can the US Supreme Court please follow suit?
So, as long as the Pennsylvania courts follow federal law (equal population and Sec 2 voting rights), seems unlikely the US Supreme Court will reverse this decision

This isn't working so hot right now, either, since a basis for poll quality is likely voter models with past vote history that performed well in years like 2014 or 2016 (when 2010 or 2012 was the comparison year), but might not work so well in 2018 https://t.co/XWpJlS6ilG

Could have been an issue in AL and VA. Polls certainly affected the pre-election narrative in both states. But, difficult to know for sure since pollsters often don't release ingredients of likely voter special sauce https://t.co/3YBRLAXAa6
Since likely voter models are important to estimates, pollsters need to do a better job at transparency, such as what ABC has done by showing estimates with different likely voter assumptions
1 point might not be a big deal, but some pollsters *only* use past vote history in their likely vote model. This probably tilts a poll even more towards Reps. Would be very interested to see what happens when ABC poll uses 2014 vote alone in likely voter model
All likely voter screens are not created equal. Reps do better on generic ballot when using past voting history; Dems do better when using enthusiasm in 2018 alone.

Would suspect this would take the DHS critical elections task force out of the loop, such that DHS could uncritically report false positive matches back to the states
This is concerning. The Social Security Administration inspector general reported that the SSA database was insufficient to determine voter eligibility due to matching issues. Would expect similar issues with the SAVE immigration database https://t.co/7A5wsReYlb

The members of the DHS critical elections infrastructure task force are serious Republicans and Democrats that were intentionally kept off Trump's voter integrity commission. Would not be surprised if they reported the truth: voter fraud is rare
If DHS investigated voter fraud as critical elections infrastructure, current DHS task force working on critical infrastructure would - I hope - be tasked with it. They're a serious group of people, not the clowns on Trump's voter integrity commission https://t.co/sBWoYL09Xv

@hezaproject @BrianAmos Analyzing the office of interest doesn't tell us anything due to the variability of the conditions the elections are run under. Justice O'Conner's dissent in Bandemer makes this point. Denying it isn't going to win over Kennedy, which is perhaps why he asked no EG question
@hezaproject @BrianAmos @BrianAmos is pointing out there is estimation uncertainty using statewide elections. There is some art to selecting elections. Averaging all available statewides tends to smooth out the noise, but some practicioners prefer to exercise judgement (competitive, lower ballot, etc)
@hezaproject @BrianAmos In other words, using statewide elections is superior to using elections to the office in question (both alone), and using statewide elections alone gets you a fairly good approximation of a full JUDGEIT, especially when you take into account election uncertainty and imputation
@hezaproject @BrianAmos That "&gt;&gt;" is fairly important. I've rarely, if ever, found a large constant shift between statewide elections and state legislative elections (removing all the variable effects that you find desirable to control for)
@hezaproject @BrianAmos Fair enough. My ordering of "best methods" is:
JUDGEIT if no imputation of uncontested elections &gt; JUDGEIT + imputation of uncontested elections using statewide offices &gt; statewide offices &gt;&gt; legislative offices
@hezaproject @BrianAmos I doubt @kinggary or @StatModeling would argue one should use district_election_result solely to evaluate a redistricting plan without the righthand side variables. But, I'll let them speak for themselves if they wish to do so
@hezaproject @BrianAmos I've used JUDGEIT in my practical and academic work. The formula is:

district_election_result = f(statewide office vote within district, incumbency, spending, etc.)

So this article actually does not support your position, since statewide elections still factor into the equation
@tiptoebull I do not know. Would seem to be dependent on a number of factors.
Happy to say that @tbonier has agreed in principle to provide @BrianAmos and I with @_TargetSmart's nationwide voter file so that we can identify reg voters assigned to wrong congressional and state leg districts. Will share with election officials to improve election integrity
@hezaproject @BrianAmos If you're interested in evaluating what happens absent effects of incumbency, scandal, etc., ultimately you need baseline partisanship for districts. EVERY practitioner I'm aware of uses statewide offices or party reg, and there is well-developed academic scholarship, too
@gelliottmorris If only we had other confirming data...
@hezaproject @BrianAmos The problem with this approach is legislative elections are confounded by contestation, candidates, etc. Practitioners therefore use statewide offices rather than legislative offices to evaluate partisanship of districts
.@BrianAmos shows how which elections used to compute efficiency gap affects conclusions on whether or not the level of harm rises to a purported violation. Using FL's current (court-adopted) congressional districts, 2008 pres = 0.002 gap, 2010 Gov = .13 gap favoring Reps https://t.co/lbhsCy7ZzF

Dear @Redistrict,

Respectfully,
Mike
https://t.co/XvsHR1dxQ3
The misinformation about "both parties" neglects NC Democrats didn't want to draw the map on the right. Bush Sr. DOJ forced them to pack blacks into another minority district (the bizarrely-shaped 12th) through Sec. 5 preclearance, an act #SCOTUS later ruled unconstitutional

@DemocraticLuntz Ahhh, but this is the 2016 redistricting in response to the voting right violation
@calahan_riley I just wouldn't hold my breath here. With appeals and the legislature likely dragging its feet, it is very possible if there is no stay deadlines will be pushed back
@calahan_riley Courts always give the redistricting body first chance to rectify constitutional defects before imposing their own plan
In the Virginia congressional voting rights litigation Republican defendants careful not to say they drew a partisan gerrymander, preferred to say they drew an incumbent protection gerrymander (#SCOTUS says that's okay)

NC got bad advice from its lawyers https://t.co/JBJs7Ijihp
In the 1990s, the courts delayed elections in NC as a result of redistricting litigation. If #SCOTUS does not issue a stay, then if the legislature doesn't promptly adopt a plan, the 3-judge panel could delay candidate filing deadlines and primary elections
NC is the only state that uses the legislative process for congressional redistricting where no governor signature required, so the NC legislature has sole authority to draw a new plan, if they must do so
There are two other partisan gerrymandering cases before #SCOTUS. Imagine Defendants' likely argument clarity needed on a standard may persuade #SCOTUS to stay NC ruling until all gets sorted out https://t.co/FEpPbFRi0l

The DMV address is different from the voter file because where a car is regularly parked is the location where the property is taxed. The lat/long of the two geocoded addresses helps provide another matching field where an address alone may yield a false negative match
In an example we've run across, in a voter file addresses are located on one street (the entrance of the apartment building) while DMV addresses are located on a cross-street (that address of the apartment's garage)
An improvement on this approach we are working on is to match on latitude/longitude of geocoded addresses. Why? Sometimes different databases have different purposes. A voter file = residence and a drivers license database = garage where a car is located https://t.co/Ammifk2HnL

Most likely, they don't want us to know how they intended all along to "find" massive vote fraud.

Could be other embarrassments, too. Example: We know Koback used private email. Did Pence do the same?

If ICE believed alleged noncitizens were engaged in voting felonies, I imagine they would take action. And for the white people who think, hey that's just a bunch of persons of color, think again. Lots of legal immigrants come from Canada and Europe. Anyone could be matched
A result of matching only name and birth year is that it will result in a high number of false positive matches. Besides vastly overstating noncitizen voting, this will erroneously flag legal noncitizens as breaking the law, and even registered voter citizens as being noncitizens
A challenge to DHS conducting an analysis of noncitizen voting is that only name and birthdate are available to match voter file data to INS data on legal noncitizens.

@electionsmith @smotus @AriBerman I refused to sign as well due to his work in the Virginia congressional redistricting case which was such a partisan hack job that the defendants removed him as an expert, presumably because he lost credibility before the court
I have no problem with Brunell's academic work, although similar provocative writings disqualified Lani Guinier from DOJ. I have no confidence he will act in a fair manner leading the decennial census. And he has no administrative experience to lead a large bureaucracy

What if ICE rounded up all the noncitizens here legally whose names happen to match in the INS and voter file databases? While exact birthdates may help reduce match errors, many states didn't give that info to Trump's voter integrity commission

My Spidey-sense is tingling a lawsuit challenging ICE's role in investigating vote fraud claims. What is the legal rational for ICE (much less DHS) to take this role? I'm not even sure Trump could issue an executive order. He may need an act of Congress

@AriBerman @NYTmag Lags in updating databases once people attain citizenship plus poor matching procedures can dramatically inflate allegations of noncitizen voting, perhaps enough to please Trump
@mlatner Presumably. I assume any work that has already been done is similarly FOIAble
I would bet DHS has already been doing the work comparing Trump's voter integrity commission's voter file data to the DHS immigration database, and Kobach's been involved in it
I don't think Trump's defunct voter integrity commission can simply transfer the voter file data it collected to DHS. DHS operates under a different set of data gathering rules than the commission did https://t.co/LVlOpCfajw
What rational would Kobach (alone or with other cronies) be appointed to a secret DHS vote fraud commission?

So sadly, Republicans appear willing to sacrifice public safety, smart government policy, efficient allocation of government resources, and better business planning in exchange for political gain
If you say: Hey! It's unconstitutional to adjust the census, keep in mind some states already adjust the population counts for felony prisoners, students, and military. Based on a 1960's Hawaii case to draw districts to equalize voter registration, #SCOTUS would likely approve
An undercount of noncitizen populations, by making people fearful of answering the decennial census, also serves the purpose of shifting political power
Asking a citizenship question is motivated primarily about political power, since drawing districts to citizen population would likely shift representation away from Latinos, Asian-Americans, and other recent immigrant groups
Asking a citizenship question can affect redistricting. In Evenwel v. Abbott, #SCOTUS ruled that states cannot be compelled to use citizenship to draw equal population districts, but left open the possibility that a state could decide to use citizenship if it choose to do so
There are many other applications as to why for public safety and good government policy, we need an accurate census. Citizenship is already asked on a large census survey, the American Community Survey, so we really don't need citizenship on the decennial census, except...
Concern is noncitizens won't respond in fear of deportation. Need accurate count for

Interestingly, this may be another blind spot in Alabama law, similar to the law that prevented Moore (as a federal candidate) from requesting a recount outside the automatic 0.5 margin. There is simply no provision for a federal candidate to contest an Alabama election https://t.co/bUKnSEi0NP

Is this evidence of vote fraud? I'd say not. The most likely explanation is conflicted Republicans voting where we'd expect to find them: in swing precincts. Vote fraud would mean a systematic subversion of *only the votes for candidates* across multiple precincts
Similarly, Moore voters in high Moore performing precincts (likely rural White) were not as conflicted, there are fewer write-ins and less divergence between straight party voting and candidates' vote shares
Jones voters were not as conflicted. In the high Jones performing precincts (likely predominantly African-American), there are fewer write-ins and less divergence between straight party voting and candidates' vote shares
The higher percentage of write-in votes in the swing precincts also suggests the presence of social pressure on Republican voters to avoid voting for Moore
Second, Republican voters in these swing precincts more often did not want to cast a vote directly for Moore, instead opted to vote straight Rep ticket. This is consistent with the idea Republican voters in competitive precincts felt more social pressure not to vote for Moore
Two plausible explanations for this pattern other than vote fraud:

First that more voters wrote in candidates in these competitive precincts. This is indeed true https://t.co/zxVoTSrw67
I've plotted the Jefferson County % straight Rep percentage minus % Moore vote versus the % vote for Jones (not including straight party or write-ins). Clear that the deviations arise in "competitive" precincts where Jones and Moore split the vote https://t.co/AId6zgaTZO
So, the "one in 15 billion" allegation involves Alabama's straight party option compared to the candidate votes. The claim is % voting straight Rep should = % voting Moore https://t.co/X57ayNuLqG
RT @srl: John Merrill, Alabama's GOP SoS, got some criticism for being too quick to probe and publicize allegations of voter fraud that loo‚Ä¶
In these precincts, Jones received over 90% of the straight party vote and vote for the candidates so the percentages align. It is in the precincts where Moore did better (predominantly White?) that there is a divergence between the two types of voting
I'm working through analysis of the allegation that the straight-party percentage doesn't line up with the people who voted for the candidates. My preliminary assessment is this appears an artifact of high (African-American?) precincts where Jones received over 90% of the vote
Moore's lawsuit is a morass of meandering mendacity

To add to the pile on, this allegation involves 10-15 sample ballots (not real ballots). Anyone could have marked these ballots. Even Merrill didn't think this was vote fraud https://t.co/WukXOklFvN https://t.co/nBRq3fsJ64

@RachelBitecofer The early voting data also supported a Northam win/Dem wave
And we'll have pundits wringing their hands pre-election as to why the Democratic candidates are so terrible, as happened to both Northam and Jones, thereby feeding a false narrative in the media echo chamber
We'll probably see the same bias in some at least some 2018 polls, artificially weighing the overall poll averages towards Republican candidates
Another consequence is that Virginia and Alabama poll averages underestimated support for the Democrats since there were pollsters with likely voter models guessing at the an more Republican electorate than actually showed up
One consequence is pollsters like Rasmussen and Morning Consult that report their results for likely voters may be reporting an electorate more approving of Trump than the true likely voters may be if they are using 2014 vote history to say who is a likely voter

Supposedly, the Democratic representative did not completely seal the envelope, and the loose flap allowed the this time Democratic SoS to identify the Democratic envelope. He pulled out the Democratic name
In 2000, instead of Easter eggs, names were written on pieces of paper, placed into envelopes, and drawn out of a replica of Lincoln's hat (they love Lincoln in Springfield Illinois)
The story goes that the night before, the Republican SoS put the Republican Easter egg into a freezer and took it out right before the drawing. The colder egg supposedly allowed the SoS to identify the Republican egg, which we drew out of the hat
In 1990, they wrote the names on pieces of paper, put them in plastic Easter eggs, and the Secretary of State drew an egg out of a replica of Lincoln's hat

@reemadamin So sadly, I've got to leave twitter for the real world for a while. If you want to follow along what happens in court see here. We've been waiting over an hour for word from the courtroom so some complex legal questions are being weighed https://t.co/y8xGY66z47
@xenocryptsite @blamasters Well, the court is determining the status of a contested ballot for Yancey (R) that could wind up the election in a tie
Surprising CNN poll with Dems +18 on the generic House ballot is of registered voters. Good case out of recent AL and VA elections that current likely voters are even more Dem leaning https://t.co/IuzRejdRIo
@reemadamin This appears correct that there can only be one recount per ¬ß 24.2-802 of the Virginia code:

"There shall be only one redetermination of the vote in each precinct." https://t.co/8cPU81g22x
@gilmored85 @PoliticsWolf Determined by lot. Could be coin flip.
@PoliticsWolf Hold your horses. There is a disputed ballot that could result in a tie!
Also note Merrill is likely at it again. He likely means "military and overseas civilian ballots" or what are commonly called UOCAVA ballots, not just military. The overseas civilians tend to outnumber military and be a very strong Dem group https://t.co/8w7lotjeaS
These votes tend Democratic, so another reason why Moore shouldn't count on provisional and overseas ballots to narrow Jones margin https://t.co/Hv8GcDiy1I
@reemadamin Ask Gore about this...this is essentially the argument the Supreme Court made to shut down the Florida recount and declare Bush president https://t.co/7GcykaKz5R
@reemadamin Yeah, this seems to be confusing language. There has to be a way to get off this crazy thing at some point! https://t.co/8mlfEfibCB
@reemadamin So here is weirdness in Virginia law. The loser of an election decided by lot can ask for a recount. So, there could be a 2nd recount?

Any person who loses the determination by lot may petition for a recount pursuant to Article 1 (¬ß 24.2-800 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of this title.
@reemadamin Of course, the consequences of a tie means control of the Virginia House of Delegates would be decided by random lot. Not a good way to do public policy https://t.co/u6PgYDl0rc
@reemadamin In some ways a tie would be fitting since with all the randomness in election administration this race really is within the "margin of error" of elections

@LarrySabato If a court orders a new election for #HD28, there will be a period of time when House of Delegates is 50-49 Dem majority. What might Dems do in that time? Change house rules on power sharing?
If the court orders a new election for #HD28, the Democrats will have a 50-49 majority of the House of Delegates. Would they adopt legislative rules to favor them in anticipation of a reversion to a 50-50 tie after the new election?
@gercohen Actually, there is an argument. The affected voters are mostly in a heavy Democratic precinct that voted in #HD88 instead of #HD28.
@gercohen What is the effect of the court invalidating the election (if it even does so)? I assume Thomas (R) is no longer seated, but then can the Democrats preemptively act to fill the vacancy, and would the court then defer to the political process and declare a new election moot?
There's a recount pending for #HD28, too, but Thomas (R) leads by 82, which is a long stretch for a recount. The #HD94 recount changed the election outcome by just 11 votes
@BorgDevil No there are only enough voters to affect the outcome of #HD28
This raises the question: could a Democratic majority in a 50-49 split House of Delegates vote to seat the Democrat in #HD28, thereby creating a 51-49 majority? I don't know the legislative rules at play, but many legislatures have the authority to determine their own membership
But, the distribution could really be a 50-49 Dem advantage if a court orders a new election for #HD28, where local election officials assigned voters to the wrong district, perhaps enough to affect the election outcome
Simonds (D) the apparent winner of Virginia House of Delegates #HD94 by one vote results in a 50-50 tie in the chamber

@reemadamin As we wait, this is a reminder if Simonds (D) won this seat, the balance of power would go from 51-49 Rep majority to power-sharing tie. Also court action requesting a new #HD28 election where Thomas (R) leads and voters were assigned to wrong districts

The relevant Alabama law (click through to "Elections" to see the full text) https://t.co/oDcc4BAnNM https://t.co/cvd2vKpfr8
Alabama state law only describes a recount if the margin is less and 0.5 points. A candidate can voluntarily waive the recount https://t.co/9XHkEmM54k
The write-ins of 22,819 are more than the margin of 20,715, but I don't think the write-ins will be "decisive" once they are counted. Some write-ins will be for Moore and Jones (people do this for some reason)
Sure, there could be errors in the tabulation, but to move the result by 13,810 votes to narrow the margin to less than 0.5% needed for a recount is highly unlikely
And now AP is reporting 100% in. Jones wins by 1.5 votes or 20,715 votes

@PollsAndVotes @Nate_Cohn @MysteryPollster The racial bloc voting analyses I do when using voter file race vs. decennial census suggests voter files consistently understate minority race. My suspicion is persons of color more often select "other" "unk" or "White" on voter files
@NotThatRKelly Because the turnout models that incorporate past vote history show Jones only winning with higher turnout, not lower turnout (I said the same about GA-6, btw)
@Nate_Cohn @MysteryPollster When we asked folks to verify race as found on the voter file, we found it to be the least consistent piece of information recorded in voter records. But the CPS isn't reliable either, since there is a upward response bias among Afr-Am in the Deep South

@PollsAndVotes @williamjordann It could be that Alabama Afr-Am have comparable voter turnout as Whites. It's that for some reason, more Afr-Am answer the CPS vote question in the Deep South, yielding less missing data than elsewhere. Could be social desirability bias at play, but who knows?

And that goes for either Moore or Jones. Whoever wins will win by a larger margin than the polling average

As if on cue, the today's new Gravis poll has Jones +4 over Moore
@gotravelgear What is the current distribution of partisans in Alabama? Nobody knows
@BrianAmos We've verified some of the errors with local election officials, who have cleaned them up. But, we're just doing this as a white hat volunteer exercise with limited resources. I suspect the errors are much deeper, especially if we investigated local elections
With @BrianAmos we've been geocoding voter files to see if voters are correctly assigned within the correct district boundaries. The results aren't pretty. Similar to what happened in Virginia #HD28, in one state we're finding voters assigned to the wrong state House district
@jacobfhsmith You're right. Still not going to hang a hat on any poll estimates in this race.
@jacobfhsmith A one point increase Moore margin in the last two JMC polls can't be distinguished from statistical noise
I'll just keep saying this: the Alabama polling is so uncertain because you can't model likely voters accurately that we really don't know what will happen. Yes. Moore could win, but I'd say the uncertainty so large Jones could win, too. WE DON'T KNOW
I'll posit that if it were a Democrat where polling showed momentum to the Republican challenger, the media narrative would be how the Democrat was doomed, even if leading narrowly. This was Northam the weekend before the Virginia Gov election

@bowendc No way. I do not have the administrative skills at this point in my career.

I don't know why Brunell left these cases off his CV, where we was retained as an expert. But I suppose essentially being fired from your job might not look good
Virginia's legislature needed to find a replacement expert, so they turned to the consultant who drew the congressional and House of Delegates maps. He testified that he drew districts for both maps in a manner that was in violation of the 14th Amendment. Thanks Brunell!
In the Virginia litigation, where I was an expert for the plaintiffs, Brunell was dropped by the legislature because he was suddenly unavailable after I filed a blistering rebuttal report to what I thought was a shoddy report
In the Florida congressional litigation, Brunell's expert report for the legislature showed the legislature did not need to pack the 5th congressional district to elect an Afr-Am candidate of choice. He was dropped after filing his report

@paulmitche11 I suspect it is more common than we may know, and is difficult to detect due to lack of transparency of precinct boundaries. They are difficult to collect, many times non-existent and even costly (we're working on collecting national boundaries)
In particular, appears Fredericksburg changed precinct 201 and 402 boundaries in 2011 to include portions of HD88. Virginia allows this and does not redraw district boundaries, just splits precincts. However, HD88 election results for 201 only start showing up in 2015 election
THREAD: I compile publicly available evidence for claim Fredericksburg gave 688 voters wrong ballot in #HD28 where Thomas (R) lead +82 votes. Changing precinct boundaries is most reasonable explanation, but enough of a mess exists that demands answers https://t.co/E2H7tokVbK

Virginia law says mail ballots must be returned to Election Office by close of polls on Election Day. While I sympathize with the 55 voters, I think the court will defer to the law unless nefarious intent can be shown
Allegation is Stafford elections office called post office repeatedly on Election Day to pick up ballots. Was notified of 10 ballots as late as 3:30pm, one ballot at 6pm. Day after election at 10am, mail carrier delivers 55 ballots. How did these ballots fall between the cracks?

@badachie I think that's correct, if you mean west of Route 1
Delaying or holding a new Alabama Senate election just because your party's nominee might lose would set a dangerous precedent, particularly thinking forward to the 2020 presidential election https://t.co/opCoUhSq01
@badachie Agree. That the 2011 and 2013 election results don't have precinct 201 in HD88 seems odd, too
So, after looking at this more closely, I still favor the explanation of precinct boundary changes since 2011 over voters given wrong ballot. But, I'd like inconsistencies in Fredericksburg's code with the city's precinct map explained
@FrankHolleman According to Fredericksburg's current precinct boundary map, precinct 201 (aka District 2 in blue), now crosses Route 1 https://t.co/GVS503v0Zf https://t.co/pxaY7GjY0P
@FrankHolleman So, I think an undocumented precinct boundary change to 201 at play. Looking at #HD88 map (green) as it was adopted in 2011, can see Route 1 serves as the precinct boundary for Precinct 201 (aka "District 2") https://t.co/Pxl59gr1ai https://t.co/A5oz8l7H8b
@FrankHolleman Meanwhile, Fredericksburg's polling locations were changed on 3-28-2017, so unlikely the Fredericksburg code simply hasn't been updated for a change to precinct 201's boundary
As pointed out by @FrankHolleman, Fredericksburg code indicates new precincts were adopted in 2011. Could explain precinct 402 anomaly. Precinct 201 change would have happened between 2015 and 2017. No change to precincts between 2015 and 2017 in the code https://t.co/DDchqFDhfm
@FrankHolleman @TylerDinucci Good catch. Precinct 402 could have been affected by the 2011 change. Still possible there was a change to 201 not in the code, for example if the polling location was no longer available

@TylerDinucci Read the entire thread
When a locality changes precinct boundaries, that does not change district boundaries, as is clearly stated in Virginia's Code https://t.co/32RY2Ae4Wm https://t.co/4bBRcuVSU3
I think precinct boundary changes are the most likely explanation for the Democrats' allegations, not that voters were given wrong ballots. Precinct boundaries may be changed for many reasons. 

But, I'd still like to see Fredericksburg's response
Two explanations:
1. After Virginia adopted 2011 House of Delegates map, Fredericksburg changed precinct 402's boundary to include part of #HD88. Before 2017 election changed 201's boundary to include part of #HD88
2. Fredericksburg gave out wrong ballots to voters in 402 and 201
In 2011, #HD88 had votes reported for Fredericksburg precinct 402, but not 201 https://t.co/bFPiqwW0k8 https://t.co/9nEnjIHtsW
In 2015, #HD88 again had votes reported for Fredericksburg 402, and now 201, too https://t.co/7i9tfPD4aC https://t.co/z2ANvkO1h1
In 2013, #HD88 had votes reported for Fredericksburg precinct 402, but not 201 https://t.co/PCQkxrfeg5
Indeed, the Virginia Code does not identify Fredericksburg precincts 201 or 402 in part of in whole as belonging in #HD88 https://t.co/32RY2Ae4Wm https://t.co/fyrOhf8ISo
Yet, the election results for #HD88 show votes cast in Fredericksburg precincts 201 and 402. This should not be possible. https://t.co/Sh0Bfv8ZBO https://t.co/lTamArZtdK
The Code of Virginia describes which precincts are in #HD28, clearly stating that Fredericksburg precincts 201 and 402 are entirely in the House district https://t.co/32RY2Ae4Wm https://t.co/LxldyLOdcu

@rickhasen Another thought: does Alabama have a sore loser law?
@rickhasen Reps would need to select new candidate promptly (what are the rules in AL?). Would need court to order state to replace candidate, new ballots printed, sent to military voters. All well in advance of Dec. 12 so people can return ballots. A mess.
@rickhasen That has never happened before to my knowledge. Do you know of a case? Real possibility some military voters would be disenfranchised

Virginia House of Delegates vote shares:
All races: Dem 53.1%, Rep 43.8%
Excluding uncontested races: Dem 47.0%, Rep 52.4%
Number of uncontested races: 23 Dem, 10 Rep
All of this matters since pundits crapped all over Northam's campaign leading into Tuesday based on the bad poll estimates. Can imagine similar dynamic emerging leading into 2018 midterms
Perhaps there is value in such a situation to give more credence to random digit dialing with vote intention screens, although such pollsters can still be susceptible to error when weighting heavily to past election demo profiles
I point this out because it's been eleven years - 2006 - since last Dem midterm wave, since string of good Rep years in opposition to Obama. We don't have a lot of good retrospective voting data (voter file or demos) if 2018 is a wave Dem year

Trump's fraudulent vote fraud commission is such a sh*tshow it needs to be shut down. There are real issues in election administration where bipartisan consensus for action exists. Chasing mythical massive vote fraud that even Rep election officials say is rare is not among them

@rickhasen How do you keep a turkey in suspense?

I'll tell you tomorrow
Virginia Senate Dems didn't get their best map. Had to give up a seat after Gov. McDonnell vetoed first plan. Result was Rep one seat advantage after 2011 election
Northam win means Reps need Gov approval to gerrymander Virginia state leg. Continued Rep leg control ironically best outcome re: gerrymandering. If Dems gain control of a chamber there could be a bipartisan logroll where both chambers gerrymander themselves, as happened in 2011
This premise not correct. Northam winning Virginia Gov means veto on congressional redistricting until 2021. If Reps regain control of state in 2021 elections they can gerrymander, just as they did in 2012 after winning 2011 elections https://t.co/TcilgL4q8o
In the canvass for a key race for control of the Virginia House of Delegates, Yancey's (R) vote margin has increased from 12 votes to 13 votes https://t.co/HM9x6BBnq6
@CrassPolitical No, #SCOTUS remanded to lower court to take another look at the case
If either the state or federal challenges to the House of Delegates districts successful, doubt Northam will be eager to sign a Rep partisan gerrymander into law. In that case, courts would likely draw new districts
Congressional trial defendants inexplicably put House of Delegates map drawer on the stand. He testified he drew House of Delegates same way he drew Congress. U.S. #SCOTUS remanded case, so it may be House of Delegates districts will be invalidated as racial gerrymander, too
Another point: if we hadn't been successful in the lawsuit overturning Virginia's 3rd Congressional District as a racial gerrymander, Virginia's congressional delegation would probably be 8-3 instead of 7-4

As an aside: Rep leaning pollsters in the RCP average (Rass, Trafalger, The Polling Company) might have done Dems a favor by showing race narrowing. Now less likely to catch Dems napping as almost happened in 2014
My read on governors race is early vote doesn't contradict polling showing narrow Northam lead. However, early vote is a small proportion of the overall vote, so much more uncertainty than high early vote states
Probably not a coincidence previous record overall turnout for non-presidential election was 2006, a wave Dem year. Strength in early voting across state, but particularly in Dem Northern Virginia. We'll see if voting interest follows thru on Election Day https://t.co/UIXHGSeHXH
...more reasonable is early vote percentage has risen higher than trend, along with overall turnout. If early vote is 7.5% of overall turnout, project 2.5 million overall turnout
A simple projection of percent early vote to 2017 yields 6.3% of vote cast early. Turnout would be 2.9 million. Would be highest overall turnout since 2006 of 2,398,589. That seems much too high...

As of Saturday, 180,043 Virginians have already voted. Obliterates the 2014 record for a non-presidential election of 123,221. In-person early voting is over, some mail ballots still to be received by Election Day. Say about 185,000 final early vote total
Some thoughts on what Virginia's early vote foreshadows about overall turnout...
Reps should be concerned the self-reported likely to vote in 2018 more Dem than the registered to vote. Typically true likely voters more Rep than reg voters
Folks getting excited by applying 2014 voted screen to 2018:
1. 2014 Rep wave year, 2018 likely Dem wave. Different people will vote
2. 2014 lowest turnout rate since 1942; non-competitive statewide races in Dem states like CA and NY
3. No 18-22 age voters https://t.co/rsj2t9lf6y
@ForecasterEnten Wasn't that kinda the point? I don't think a pollster like Gallup wanted their accuracy measured anymore since they were getting negative press
@kkeeltygartland @stevesingiser Fairfax County also has satellite in-person early voting locations at government centers, making in-person early voting more convenient. Elsewhere must vote at election office only
Virginia early vote by region continues to show Northern Virginia leading the way (some small localities without 2013 early vote data excluded) https://t.co/y3K3e8MfqD
Virginia #earlyvote update: 180,043 voted as of 11/5. This includes Saturday's in-person early voting.  Easy surpasses Virginia non-presidential record of 123,221 in 2014. Mail ballots continue to be accepted until Election Day https://t.co/b6icCHS3rT
American cowboys will be deployed to assist Japanese samurais shoot down North Korean missiles
I find this the most fascinating stat of Virginia's early vote. Latinos getting woke would be an election game changer https://t.co/qqKJKUQ402
@mozumder A pollster with a registration-based sample can know if a person has already voted, and thus does not need to rely on a likely voter screen. In higher early voting states could calibrate demos to early vote, but early vote is a small slice of electorate so probably not worth it
Still a lot of uncertainty given how small a percentage the early vote is of the overall vote, and of the variability among the polls. Virginia will still be won on Election Day, and the voters could be sensitive to last minute election dynamics
To repeat yesterday: What does it all mean? The election is far from over. Virginia is an excuse-required state. I'd guess the early vote represents only 7% of the total vote or so. Nothing here to contradict polling showing a narrow Northam lead
@ryanpougiales Good chance it does not include Saturday. I noted updated Sunday totals last weekend.
Fairfax County, whose 2017 early vote is 36,907 versus 25,659 in 2013, has the largest raw increase of 11,248 of any Virginia locality
Manassas City (2017 is 223% of the 2013 early vote) and Manassas Park (205%), localities with a significant Latino community, have the largest percent increases of any Virginia localities relative to 2013
The 2017 early vote change relative to 2013 shows the turnout increase statewide is primarily from Northern Virginia, it's increase of 24,705 accounts for 61% of the statewide increase (some small localities with no 2013 reported data are omitted) https://t.co/3UIQHaFZC2
Virginia #earlyvote update: 161,719 voted as of 11/4. This is the last day of in-person early voting. Mail ballots may still be returned until Election Day. The 2017 early vote obliterates the previous record of 123,221 for a non-presidential election set in 2014. https://t.co/Z8sQ9TNM3n
@PollsterPatrick @Nate_Cohn Good news is missing data/over-report bias issues in the CPS don't appear to greatly affect demographic breakdown. But...the variation in smaller-sized state CPS polls plus you're looking at an off-off-year election cautions usefulness
@PollsterPatrick This from the Rass poll gives me pause that the race is actually tied, as they have it (still think the race is close) https://t.co/WwHYzYAqIv
@Nate_Cohn @ryanpougiales Okay. Thanks!
@Nate_Cohn @ryanpougiales So, 2013 vote history is in the likely voter model?
@ryanpougiales @Nate_Cohn Sort of feels like that, doesn't it? Why no 2013 vote history except if using a national model?
Folks noting how early vote may be counted later, could see Gillespie jump out to lead only to see it evaporate as more votes counted. I'll add another twist: 22 localities had their electronic machines decertified. Will have new voting systems for 2017 https://t.co/I3NMFYS2pf
Partial answers might be found in the areas where early voting hasn't reached 2013 levels yet. There's more Rep-leaning localities among these places. So, I'll give Northam an edge based on early voting, which is where the poll averages are, but there's still much uncertainty
I expect a higher percentage of the vote cast early in 2017 than in 2013, with the increase primarily coming from Dem areas. Perennial questions: are Dems more engaged than Reps? Are Dems doing more early vote mobilization? Are they cannibalizing Election Day?
So, what to make of all of this? First, the election is nowhere near over. Virginia is an excuse required state, with more generous excuses than other such states. About 5.4% of the 2013 vote was cast early. Presidential elections see higher early voting rate. Was 12.5% in 2016.
Of the 25 Virginia localities that have not reached their 2013 early vote total, Cuccinelli won 17, McAulliffe won 8. All are outside Northern Virginia
Roanoke County has lowest early vote in Virginia compared to 2013: 2,219 in 2013/1, 487 in 2017 or only 67% of 2013 total.  Cuccinelli won this county with 58% of the vote in 2013
Manassas City has the largest early vote increase over 2013 of any Virginia locality: 428 in 2013/860 in 2017, or +201%. This city among the largest Latino communities in Virginia
Virginia 2017 current early vote to 2013 overall comparison (excluding a few localities with no 2013 early vote precincts). Fairfax County alone accounts for nearly a third of the statewide increase (+8,510 within the county, or +133% over 2013) https://t.co/dmNfoXlJny
Virginia #earlyvote update: 147,148 voted as of 11/3. Surpassed 2013 non-presidential record of 121,359. One more day of in-person early voting to go, with some mail ballots still outstanding, too https://t.co/ZPG58FUo7K

Many localities are providing map images in pdfs, which will be difficult to convert into a machine-usable format. And some localities can't provide any precinct map
@openelex Even when these precinct boundary data don't have use restrictions, some localities ask as much as $1,000 (in this case, Suffolk County, NY)

@ItsYusky @christyree69 @RalphNortham Virginia early vote looks typical to me. Always skews older, particularly in an excuse-required state. I caution drawing conclusions for either candidate

Virginia is an excuse required state, but has lenient excuses. One is being away from home jurisdiction on Election Day. Many NoVa voters qualify if they work in DC, so tend to see disproportionate early vote because of NoVa population and more eligible to early vote
Virginia currently has 5,475,976 registered voters, about 235,000 more than 5,240,286 in 2013. We'll get a better sense on a turnout projection (as percentage of registered voters) from early vote towards the end of next week

@bowendc It is in my expert report. The gist:
-draw VRA districts
-draw most compact plan possible
-compare adopted districts to ideally compact districts
-if compactness reduced more than 50%, discretionary factors predominate over constitution compactness requirement
Clarifications:
-Compactness and contiguity are *only* state constitutional criteria. Argument is simply Virginia must follow federal equal pop and VRA concerns, and state constitution
-Predominance test agnostic as to which discretionary factors take precedence over compactness

@ryancbriggs There could be a number of reasons related to how the Census Bureau conducts the CPS. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that they hired a new interviewer who didn't follow protocols
I and others have discussed these issues with the folks who compile the CPS voting and registration report. They are aware of them, but haven't taken action yet (obviously)
@dburbach @IsraelKafka I only have access to some of the CPS paradata, so I don't know. It could be a specific interviewer not following interview protocol (buried in CPS reports, this happens), it could be a cycling of in-person respondents into phone interviews, etc.
@IsraelKafka I can't say for sure, but in additional work trying to explain this phenomenon, I suspect changes in the way in which the Census Bureau interviews people is a partial explanation
Now, I wouldn't recommend using the CPS to estimate the turnout effect of voter id laws in Wisconsin, anyway (unless the effect is really big). The margin of error of the sub-group will be large with 78 respondents in 2012 and 61 in 2016
When I correct for non-response and over-report bias, I estimate Wisconsin African-American turnout declined 7.5 points, while nationally the decline was the same 7.5 points
In 2012, 7 of 78 (9%) WI African-American respondents had missing CPS vote data

In 2016, 22 of 61 (36%) had missing data

When the Census Bureau counts missing data as "did not vote" WI African-American appears to alarmingly declined when, in fact, fewer answered the survey
The shorter version:

The Census Bureau counts all persons with missing data as "did not vote" in their survey. This is a terrible practice. No other pollster treats their missing data this way

@electionsmith @ryangabrielson @pamelacolloff The deeper problem lies in the Census Bureau's voting and registration report. They improved when they started computing citizen-VAP turnout rates in response to my earlier work, but they still have a ways to go

@dabowen01 I'm not a top political scientist, obviously
@MaxHailperin You mentioned threat surface. This involves both magnitude of harm and probability of success. I'm trying to convey there are differences between DoS attacks that block attempted votes and attempted changes to ballots
@MaxHailperin Yep, didn't even mention that. Although ballots most vulnerable to denial of service attacks, much less so manipulation, since difficult to automate manipulation of votes on scanned ballots with many different ballot styles
This is not a good system. There are one or two entities between the voter and election official that can through no fault of voter or election official screw up the transmission of a ballot
This scenario can happen: a military or overseas voter emails a ballot to the DoD portal, which converts it to a fax, sends it to a fax service, which converts it to an email, and it is sent to a local election official
@NelsonMRosario I know @aztammyp. She's not my target audience. (And btw, I consulted to EAC and FVAP on these issues, too)
To confuse things further: the Department of Defense commissioned the creation of a portal that accepts a scanned email ballot and sends it as a fax to a locality. Is this a fax or electronic vote?
Now, here's the thing: many localities use fax services that accept an incoming fax and relay it to election officials in an email. Is this a fax or an electronic vote?
Many states have laws allowing military and overseas civilians to fax completed mail ballots to election officials https://t.co/ewdQTkuM72
@Taniel The most sensible solution is to believe people can be redeemed and allow felons to regain their civil rights once they've completed their sentences
@Taniel On the flip side, a confusing law leads to non-intentional mistakes of ineligible felons being registered, bolstering those who claim vote fraud is rampant, and can have serious consequences for the poor souls given bad advice by government officials
@Taniel Implementation is a frequent problem with restrictive voting laws. Local election officials confused by law decide how they will interpret, leading to illegal discrimination

Census Bureau may release tools with 2020 census to estimate the error they induce with disclosure-avoidance protocols (these protocols protect confidentiality of respondents). Could spark lawsuits as to what population is needed to have viable VRA Sec 2 claim
Implication for VRA Section 2 litigation: #SCOTUS in Bartlett required plaintiffs to have a claim to draw district with 50% VAP of the target minority population. It may be that a district with, say, 49.5% Black VAP with released data actually is over 50%
Redistricting nerds: I learned since 2000 the Census Bureau has applied disclosure-avoidance protocols to total pop and VAP by the race/ethnicity breakdowns, which means small error has been added to these numbers (overall total pop and VAP are the actual enumeration)

A different approach is more government involvement. Florida just implemented on-line voter registration, which will enable better updating of voter registration for movers. Next step: automatic registration that allows updates from DMV offices

@rickhasen Really different than O'Conner's Bandemer or Scalia's Vieth opinion? Their claim (which I don't agree with) is elections are messy, hard to separate redistricting effects
@darren04 I think the secret is using the Chrome browser. I only get 280 characters when I use it.
Common in election lawsuits for plaintiffs and defendants to put forward competing experts on matters of theory and statistics. Heck, academics argue among themselves in our scholarship. Law and academia have different standards that sometimes don't mix well
Another example: we lost a compactness challenge to Virginia's state legislative districts because the defense was able to hire experts who said the districts were compact "enough" to comply with state constitution. Faced with competing experts, court says has to side with state
In the Michigan case, the expert applied a 95% confidence interval to a prediction interval in a regression with few observations. I argued in response this was inappropriate. Now the judge has competing expert opinions. To a judge not steeped in statistics, this is gobbledygook
Of course this is gobbledygook, but Roberts isn't that far off when he criticizes social science on this account. Statistics can be manipulated and open to interpretation, especially by a motivated expert
Therefore, any redistricting plan that had all districts within a 35-65% Dem performing range would be "symmetric" in that they had equal chance of electing Dem or Rep
For those thinking partisan symmetry a workable partisan gerrymandering standard:

In Michigan case cited in the amicus brief promoting partisan symmetry, the expert argued a 35% Dem performing district had equal chance of electing Dem candidate

But there are important differences. For example, Maryland plaintiffs are challenging a single district, Wisconsin plaintiffs are challenging entire plan
Maryland 1st Amendment claim case in Benisek v Lamone would then rise to importance since it is furthest along in litigation track

There are some caveats: you might overpack where an additional minority district possible, and need to consider primary elections
If you're drawing safe Democratic districts as a partisan gerrymander, most likely they'll survive VRA Sec 2 racial gerrymandering challenge
And thus begins a new era of racial gerrymandering: draw partisan gerrymanders that waste minority votes, then check if possible Sec 2 claim
With the 2013 Shelby County decision, former covered state and local gov'ts no longer need to examine race to justify new plan under VRA Sec 5
NC leg claims they didn't look at race, only election results, which correlate highly. #SCOTUS has ruled previously okay to just look at politics  https://t.co/WvWA412AVI
@abfrancois It is a PR campaign that has taken a life of its own, distorting the legal value of the efficiency gap
@abfrancois There is no bright line when a plan fails an efficiency analysis, other than an ad hoc, poorly defined threshold put forward by the authors
So we'll see what Kennedy does. My guess is he doesn't adopt efficiency gap as standard, but may be convinced by lower court weighing all evidence
Bandemer court (decision where partisan gerrymandering justicible) thought elections too variable, needed more than 1 election for evidence
Where WI plaintiffs may have chance is unlike Bandermer, where only 1 election in evidence, WI has 2 elections w/ anti-majoritarian outcomes
Efficiency gap is at a fundamental level a measure of votes into seats, same as all other gerrymandering measures Kennedy has previously rejected
By elevating "efficacy gap" has the last best hope, liberals are setting themselves up for a short-run defeat when Kennedy says: this is the best you got?
In the long history of politics, we know one party will not dominate forever. One day there will be a 5-4 liberal #SCOTUS majority
There are also political solutions: Can Dems gain control of key offices to block Rep  gerrymandering and force redistricting to courts?

@JRJohnson_PSU Other countries do this and it works. We can learn from them how to administer a national id
@MeanestBossEver In countries with national id, by law every citizen by age 16 is required to get id. Government must make id accessible
@HHHElections Vendors and localities could have reported DHS notification up their chain to the states. That could have worked, but it didn't here
@HHHElections There are reasons why DHS notifies vendors and affected units directly, rather than state gov'ts, in other critical infrastructure areas
@HHHElections I agreed DHS needs to update policies and Congress laws. What I'm pointing out is they were constrained by existing policy infrastructure
@michelleshafer @HHHElections And yet, that is what DHS does for all industries covered by a critical infrastructure designation
@HHHElections This is what DHS does with other cyber-intrusions in other critical designation areas, like hospitals, etc. Where were your complaints?
@HHHElections I support revising laws and policies as needed, but titling your post as "NOW you tell me" makes it sound DHS was negligent. They weren't.
@HHHElections I know. Was also county IT departments not the election office.
16/ What I'd like to see: end voter reg with a national identification card serving as voter reg, as many other modern democracies do
15/ Alabama shuttered DMV offices in predominantly African-American counties, making it more difficult to get id
14/ Photo id has become a new form of Jim Crow. Court found Texas intentionally discriminated in way it implemented voter id law
13/ I support automatic voter reg, but it doesn't serve people who don't need drivers licenses
12/ Some states taking proactive role in voter reg with "automatic" voter reg where DMV offices automatically register folks
11/ Heck, North Dakota doesn't even have voter registration. Show up with your id and vote.
10/ Voter reg does not need to be this way. Studies find "Same Day Reg" states where reg and vote at polling place turnout 5-7 points higher
9/ Organization got into voter reg to assist disadvantaged people. Result? Attacks these orgs for fraud, laws criminalizing trivial errors
8/ By placing burden on people rather than gov't, voter reg is among the single-most effective vote suppression tools in nation's history
7/ In the South, voter registration was part of Jim Crow. Black person walking up to register to vote? Close the door and go out to lunch
6/ Even as late as 2000 in Wisconsin, rural areas of the state were exempt from voter registration
5/ Around 1850, states governments started adopting voter registration, but only for big cities where their political opponents lived
4/ In the 1st century of U.S. history, local governments were responsible for maintaining lists of people who could vote.
3/ But as you do the busywork of registering to vote, know that you are doing it because someone doesn't want you to vote. Get mad.
2/ Yes, register to vote and update your voter registration if needed. Check local and state election websites for tools to assist you

@HHHElections There is an interesting debate as to whether election centralization should happen. But DHS was respecting local control of election admin

Many other developed democracies have a national citizenship card that serves as voter registration. This can be done
Could all be resolved if the government proactively issued ids with biometric markers to everyone, as recommended by Baker-Carter commission
An extreme proposal like amending NVRA using the gun background check for voter verification makes more "moderate" proposals seem palatable
Well-established Kris Koback wants to amend National Voter Registration Act (aka Motor Voter). Wants more verification checks and purging
To return to John Lott: easy to assume his voter/gun check proposal intended to troll the left, but I think a deeper agenda
A bad data example: NC state legislator who co-sponsored state's voter id law had record of voting in two states https://t.co/2gWwDCwfqt
Which gets me to Ken Block's allegations of double voting. Not only is his study limited by list matching issues, he assumes data accurate
Data matching assumes accurate data. In challenging GA's exact match requirement we found a voter who provided correct info but not verified
Seems reasonable we could check lists against one another, but in practice not 100% accurate, as I've explained https://t.co/8iD2mVZFGX

Extremely troubling person with no election admin experience asked to testify before vote fraud commission
Election officials verify addresses before accepting voter reg. Block could have talked to them to understand, but wild claims plays better
Block claims any address with a PO Box is improper. Doesn't know that RV folks and homeless may use non-residential addresses
Block's over-confidence in his data extends to another part of the report: alleged improper addresses
It is possible that some of Block's alleged double votes are real, but irresponsible to make public accusations without proper investigation
A classic example of admin error causing false positive double vote: NC sponsor of id law voting twice in NC and SC https://t.co/iT20h6Iaws
Even if 7,271 alleged double votes are recorded in the databases, Block does not consider the possibility of administrative error
The company's data and matching algorithm are proprietary, so we have no way to know what errors may arise in it
States do not publicly release SSN, so Block contracted a fraud detection company to append SSN5 to his list of 60,000 suspect double voters

Thread where John Lott makes wild vote fraud claim. Doesn't ask election officials for facts. When I ask, revealed to be programming bug https://t.co/iJr6ErHYrx
@JohnRLottJr Did you talk to the election officials about this isolated case? They said they were going to investigate cc: @LACountyRRCC
@JohnRLottJr No, Sen. Franken's election is not fraudulent. The courts considered your accusations and dismissed them. Get over it
@JohnRLottJr Most states permit felons to vote once they've done their time. Many developed countries don't even disenfranchise them at all
@JohnRLottJr So, this *allegation* was from last November. What did the subsequent investigation find? Voter fraud or administrative error?
@JohnRLottJr A simple solution to the felon voting problem is limiting disenfranchisement to felony prisoners, a direction state policies are going
@JohnRLottJr The courts have found the difficulty with felon voting is proving intent when felons are given bad info about their eligibility
@davedaley3 @PoliticsWolf @tbonier The argument I only meant to cripple you, not kill you, isn't a compelling defense for illicit activity

@JohnRLottJr Fortunately, there have been many elections since you wrote your unpublished manuscript in 2008
@JohnRLottJr There are no "fraud hot spots." Vote fraud is a rare event. Even Kobach has only found 11 cases in Kansas out of millions of votes cast
@JohnRLottJr No published research finds 12 point turnout effects from a ballot initiative. (Again, this is to point out the potential interactions)
@JohnRLottJr But just because you have 300 obs w/ panel data, doesn't mean that you can't have weird multicollinearity between variables
@JohnRLottJr Since the Matsusaka article was written in 1992, there has been a tremendous amount of work in multi-level modeling
@JohnRLottJr Perhaps you can point to published research that finds a ballot initiative has more than a percentage point effect on turnout (not roll-off)
@JohnRLottJr I understand it quite well. And omitted variable bias occurs only if omitted variable is correlated with your variable of interest and Y
@tifotter Seriously, go the the national hurricane center website. Lots of maps and data https://t.co/sK1zhwPqTF
@tifotter It's my precious
The 12pm radar frame may show the turn north. Or is it a wobble? More data needed. It's like getting the next precinct reported
Obsessively reloading for the latest radar image is as bad a habit as reloading for the latest election results
@JohnRLottJr If you are able to rerun your models, I'd encourage you to post your replication data and code so that others can verify your work
@JohnRLottJr Then you report effects of state level variables w/o accounting for interactions. You can't interpret directly coefficients w/ interactions
@JohnRLottJr You've got more state laws than years in your analysis, so you either had to make choices or the computer made it for you as your df -&gt; 0
@JohnRLottJr Then you interact these state level election laws with county level demos (plus county fixed effects). How many state laws did you interact?
@JohnRLottJr You've added so many state level variables, but only have 50 states, that you don't have a grasp on possible multicollinearity issues
@JohnRLottJr I'm pointing out nonsensical negative 12 point turnout effect for the presence of a business reg ballot initiative as indicative of cost
@JohnRLottJr Just because you're looking at counties, doesn't mean you can add many state level variables without cost (i.e., multi-level model)
@JohnRLottJr You're predicting turnout, and added a slew of additional state level variables, as well as adding more categories for ballot initiatives
@JohnRLottJr I think that's what you're missing. He was predicting roll-off, and didn't theoretically think election laws affected roll-off
@POLITICO_Steve Is it too soon to note how some long range models have #Jose doing a loop and then heading west again?
A reason why I believe Trump's voter integrity commission's end game is recommendation to repeal or amend NVRA (aka Motor Voter)

@JohnRLottJr County demographics vary little over time (if at all). Including county fixed effects w/ county demos and interactions? Too many variables!
@JohnRLottJr Whenever you interact variables, you can't directly interpret coefficients. I see no discussion in your paper of average predicted effects
@JohnRLottJr No one that has published on ballot initiatives finds any turnout effects of that magnitude. Should be a tip-off your model is mis-specified
@JohnRLottJr You likely have weird interactions between state level variables, the silly -12 point effect for business regulation initiative a symptom

As a consequence, I don't trust any of the findings in the paper (which isn't peer-reviewed and would never be published in reputable place)
That's just a dumb finding. I suspect 30+ state level variables in combination perfectly predict some state turnouts (aka multicollinearity)
Presence of business regulation ballot initiative decreases turnout by 12 points!? We've found the single-most effective vote suppressant!
When you have too many factors trying to simultaneously predict what are really conditions across 50 states, you get gems like this https://t.co/kLGaLf4QxU

15/ If I have a reservation where evidentiary standard for partisan gerrymandering is going, it is one election insufficient to bring claim
14/ And don't get me started on magic bullet efficiency gap. Court looked at lots of evidence other than efficiency gap to make ruling
13/ WI court in Whitford ruled plaintiffs met evidentiary burden. No need to muddy issue offering tests (that Kennedy previously rejected)

@tbonier Plan the Reps put forward was unbiased at 50%. It was designed to win supermajority at ~60% of vote. Apportionment board plan did not
@tbonier In Alaska, the gerrymandering that was happening had to do with responsiveness, not partisan bias (Reps wanted to win super-majority seats)
8/ O'Lear court said there was no manageable standard, it didn't put a seal of approval on a vetted partisan symmetry standard
@tbonier If your party regularly wins 60% of the vote, what happens when your party wins 40% is immaterial since that will rarely, if ever, happen
7/ The judge did not find Katz's claim credible, but we lost case on summary judgment because court said there was no manageable standard

Future cases this decade like overturning VA congress districts &amp; AL state leg districts as racial gerrymanders more difficult to prove
Outside groups will have more difficult time showing 14th Amendment violation of improper use of race, since NC will say they didn't use it
Eventually, outside groups will compute race data for the NC districts: will these outside groups be able to show Sec 2 violation? Maybe
If NC was still covered by VRA Sec 5, NC would have had to examine race data to show districts would not retrogress minority representation
Of course, African-Americans vote nearly 90%+ for Democratic candidates, so everyone knows who lives in the high performance Dem precincts
In response, the NC legislature implemented a partisan gerrymander, and refuse requests for race data on new districts (can't look at race!)
