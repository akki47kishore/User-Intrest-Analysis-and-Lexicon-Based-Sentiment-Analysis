@LeeMall83 @MrRighTNoW_818 @KayDMusiQ There are no red flags and this is unlike any other Marvel movie. This is a Star Wars-level film for Disney in every way - and one of their biggest movies ever for that matter - and they are treating it as such. It‚Äôs that simple.
From what I am hearing -- and to answer a bunch of similar responses -- this late embargo has nothing at all to do with concerns about the movie and everything to do with concerns about major reveals and plot twists. This is exactly how Disney treats its STAR WARS movies, btw

@NikkiNovak @Fandango @readyplayerone @wbpictures That said, I do think Spielberg approached RPO from a very audience-first perspective
@NikkiNovak @Fandango @readyplayerone @wbpictures Well, I think all directors have the audience in mind when they're creating a movie -- I think Rian was more responding to the reaction after the fact. If that influences him at all moving forward in terms of working on more Star Wars movies.
Also: Considering @BacktotheFuture is one of the most referenced films in #ReadyPlayerOne, I asked Spielberg to reflect on that film and what it means to him. (Also, what it was like to direct the DeLorean...)

@DestinyDreadful @KevinMcCarthyTV @RottenTomatoes I think if it wins, it'll win for Best Adapted Screenplay. I am currently picking MUDBOUND to take that category, but I think it's between those two

@KevinMcCarthyTV @RottenTomatoes They are both very different movies, but I feel like a win for GET OUT means more and says more, and it's the more popular choice, period.
@KevinMcCarthyTV @RottenTomatoes Yeah right now I am leaning towards Get Out winning Pic and Del Toro winning Director. I think all these new Academy members are shaking things up, and you can't just rely on historical stats anymore. Get Out has the momentum, I think

#BlackPanther
@THATJacqueline @rejects @marcbernardin @ValerieComplex @JoelleMonique @SabinaHasNoR What is this game - is it a movie I like or a movie poster I like?
@midasretouch06 @Marvel I got no skin in this game -- I agree Marvel puts out great content. I'm a big fan of their movies. I just think it's a fun box office story to follow
Also IMAX will be a bigger factor as #InfinityWar was shot entirely with IMAX cameras. Curious to see how they lean into that as we approach its release
I think the key to what should shape up to be a fun battle between INFINITY WAR &amp; BLACK PANTHER will be repeat business. May is stacked, and early indications suggest BP will see a ton of repeat viewings. Just sayin, it‚Äôs gonna be fun to watch
@KevinMcCarthyTV It ain‚Äôt easy to clear $200M in three days. CIVIL WAR had tremendous buzz and BLACK PANTHER crushed those opening numbers too. Just saying it‚Äôs not a sure thing - IW needs to do some work to get it there
@Melanism I think that‚Äôs a no brainer- just depends on how much they have to lean into
Then once we‚Äôre past opening weekend, #InfinityWar kicks off what might be the biggest May we‚Äôve ever seen, with a DEADPOOL sequel two weeks later followed by a STAR WARS movie a week after that. Will #BlackPanther top 2018 at the box office? It just might
A lot of people coming at me thinking #InfinityWar is guaranteed to clear #BlackPanther‚Äôs numbers and I just don‚Äôt know about that. BP opened bigger than ULTRON in 3-day and is about to open bigger than the first AVENGERS in the 4-day. https://t.co/6CwTLS2h2G
Fact: #BlackPanther crushed it at the box office this weekend. Spending Presidents Day morning talking all about its massive debut on TV and radio https://t.co/2Z3JyVi9n3
UPDATE: #BlackPanther nabbed the second best Sunday of all time (behind only THE FORCE AWAKENS), and its 3-day total has risen to $201M. Some are now saying it could do $243M for 4-day, which would make it 2nd all time. Damn.
#BlackPanther marks the 10th Certified Fresh movie in a row for @MarvelStudios. The last of only two MCU movies not to go CF was THOR: THE DARK WORLD. Name another studio that‚Äôs put out ten CF movies in a row. That‚Äôs damn impressive. üçÖ https://t.co/DLbCGZA3PC
@sgscottieg614 Will it?
RT @Fandango: 11.21.2018 https://t.co/HchdeU0k5K
@Ike_Gold It includes Thurs night, Fri, Sat and Sunday. These numbers may shift slightly on Monday AM, but not by much. Likely to land somewhere around $218-220M for the entire four days
After only three days in theaters, #BlackPanther has already exceeded the entire domestic gross of THOR, ANT-MAN, CAP: THE FIRST AVENGER &amp; INCREDIBLE HULK, and it will pass THE DARK WORLD by tomorrow https://t.co/zw16IoFNSQ
UPDATE: $192M is the official 3-day number for #BlackPanther, just topping AGE OF ULTRON ($191M) for the MCU‚Äôs second best opening ever (5th all time) and absolutely crushing all previous February records.
@frankpallotta üôÑ
@frankpallotta This was always a fairly coveted holiday weekend at the box office, but after this movie I think this weekend becomes a much bigger deal
Note that if this movie can top $226M in four days, it beats THE AVENGERS opening four-day total and certainly rivals that film for Marvel‚Äôs best opening ever. 
(p.s. it‚Äôs February)
Early estimates for #BlackPanther peg it at $194M for the weekend, which would top AGE OF ULTRON ($191M) for Marvel Studios‚Äô 2nd Best opening ever and give it the 5th best opening of all time. https://t.co/ongNH8qvMx

@FLIIEaglesFLII Two stingers - as for trailers, nothing that hasn't previously been released online, from what I know
@filmadelphia @mattsinger It was a Cap movie. The graphic includes movies starring characters who had not previously been featured in their own MCU movie.
@AshCrossan @pablohidalgo You should've saved this for the junket interviews, Ash
@5States @mikeryan @mattsinger Solo will not die in Solo, tho
@filmadelphia @mattsinger They did not include Avengers because those characters had already been featured in an MCU movie. The Guardians we had not seen prior to their debut film
@mikeryan @mattsinger Solo is a Solo movie, but not an MCU solo movie. It's a Star Wars Solo solo movie, though
@mikeryan @mattsinger Solo is not an MCU solo movie, Mike. It's a Star Wars movie. They are separate, but released by the same studio, so I can see where you would make that error

@xNikkiyx The movie is set in Africa and features an ensemble of actors playing members of varying African tribes, hence me calling it a beautiful African movie
@xNikkiyx From its music to its setting to its characters, there is a beautiful African vibe that surrounds this movie and embraces its every moment. That is what I meant by "100% African"

This is great. I love hearing about all of the different groups and churches renting out entire theaters for #BlackPanther. This is most definitely a film that deserves to be celebrated in that way https://t.co/KK1t70NOzD

The best part of #BlackPanther is how it unravels this deeply emotional &amp; complex story about family ties &amp; protecting your tribe. While lots will tout Michael B. Jordan as the stand-out, my favs were Danai Gurira &amp; especially BP's lil sis, Letitia Wright https://t.co/VSEwa98BnI

#Sundance favorites for me: 
EIGHTH GRADE
BURDEN
ASSASSINATION NATION
THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS, THE TALE
THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST
MONSTERS AND MEN https://t.co/l8aSRcIe4x
@rejects @Filmdrunk I can respect that
@Filmdrunk I respect that opinion but I don‚Äôt agree with it

EIGHTH GRADE/ASSASSINATION NATION double feature ftw 
#Sundance https://t.co/oiNyVx4Op4
Odessa Young, Bella Thorne, Hari Nef, Abra demolish the movie. PURGE-esque, HEATHERS-esque, crazy entertaining and everything a wild Midnight movie should be.
ASSASSINATION NATION is friggin‚Äô brilliant! A sick, slick, stylish, hilarious, wickedly violent tale about the dangers of social media in the age of the mob mentality. 
#Sundance https://t.co/RRisT5vH1q
We all see different things in the art we consume and we should always strive to be respectful of that. If you dig something someone else doesn‚Äôt, then that‚Äôs all good. That‚Äôs supposed to happen. Embrace it and talk about it. 
#Sundance
@WorlJam It‚Äôs a complicated film and the reaction will certainly be mixed, in part because the film lingers with him as a klansman for a good while.
@Die_Wil_Wheaton I agree, talk about someone who course corrected their career and is taking on some great roles right now
Loved THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST, about a teen (@ChloeGMoretz) forced to attend a gay conversion camp. Funny and biting w/ powerful messages about being the person you want to be. A fest fav for me
#Sundance https://t.co/8jX3FYTUSw
@frankpallotta This was inspired by a buddy who went on a date to a horror movie recently
THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS is both mind blowing and heartbreaking - such a fascinating doc about a set of triplets separated at birth who accidentally find each other 20 years later. Some crazy twists in this one
#Sundance https://t.co/c5ODLsj44F
This is great, not all theaters have this. https://t.co/i9A2xIlfIP
The first draft of the BURDEN script was written in 1998. Forrest Whitaker became attached in 2006. The film was finally made in 2016, debuting at #Sundance in 2018. Took a minute, but this film is gonna make some noise this year
@SandroCorsaro Oh believe me, we are all counting down the days
BURDEN is the strongest film I have seen at #Sundance so far. Exceptional performances from Garrett Hedlund and Andrea Riseborough in the real life story of a Klansman who finds love &amp; eventually redemption https://t.co/pnYWA5kYxc
Eagles/Patriots Super Bowl is like a living nightmare for New York sports fans. Is there any way for both of them to lose?
Not a dry eye in the house for WHAT THEY HAD, a warm but heartbreaking film about a family who rally around their mother as she loses her memory due to Alzheimer‚Äôs. Some big laughs but lots of tears, too. I‚Äôm kind of a mess

I finally got to meet and hang out with my fav Tessa Thompson tonight, so I‚Äôm good. I can leave #Sundance now.
Update: At the Sorry to Bother You after party, I asked Armie Hammer if his line of coke was indeed the longest line ever snorted in a movie and he laughed, and said ‚ÄúThat line would kill anyone who attempted it.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs @TessaThompson_x on new roles, new opportunities, new voices and how excited she is that movies like SORRY TO BOTHER YOU now have a chance to exist

@TessaThompson_x Also Armie Hammer may have broken the record for longest line of cocaine snorted in a movie. We‚Äôll need to dig into that some more. This movie is so crazy
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU is funny, inventive, wildly absurd and, thanks to @TessaThompson_x‚Äôs character Detroit, features maybe the best earring collection ever.

The first trailer for the #Sicario sequel is out and it's rad. I've spoken to people who've seen this and they say it's fantastic. Can't wait.

@Sean_OConnell Ridley Scott just deleted a main character and reshot all his scenes in, like, a day. I say buckle in and bring on May 2018!
No way! As a movie fan, how do you not want an Avengers film and a Star Wars film to come out in the same month?? I say bring it on! https://t.co/sJZvY33Lc7
@ssantos16 @ManaByte Because I think it's important for Star Wars to remind us not to take Star Wars so damn seriously all the time. To let go, to embrace a different experience. It's the only way for the series to live on
I think more than one #StarWars movie has produced great writing, but I agree that #TheLastJedi has inspired a lot of fantastic pieces, from ones about inclusion to loss to its themes and how it kinda trolls Star Wars fans. Lots of variety https://t.co/YUjYB2ic14

@paulscheer @Sean_OConnell @MdellW @jenyamato @bdgrabinski @slashfilm @jeffcannata @DannyTRS Exactly, she is way more practical than spiritual. In order to ever see that from her, it has to use her instead of her using it
In order for these brands to evolve, they need to take risks. In order for them to take risks, we need to let go of taking it all too seriously. In order to let go, we need to laugh - both at it and at ourselves
Interesting to see how reactions differ between Thor: Ragnarok and Last Jedi. Both films become borderline genre parodies at times, but w/ Thor, it‚Äôs way more accepting. Is it because of director? Prior expectations? Both?
@slashfilm @jeffcannata @DannyTRS I dug it lots, it more establishes Poe as a guy too confident for his own good

@epophoto @rubinsafaya @cevangelista413 @slashfilm It's an interesting debate! I would say the rating should be about the film and not the conversation around the film. You are not rating the larger cultural conversation, you are rating the movie
@rubinsafaya @cevangelista413 @slashfilm This is true, except in 2500 reviews, every one of his B- reviews he has marked Fresh
@cevangelista413 @slashfilm So I think another interesting discussion point is whether or not he broke the rules
@cevangelista413 @slashfilm This is a good piece, but one thing not mentioned is whether he broke the rules. Totally agree about not ganging up on an opinion that differs from the norm, but If the critic shows a lack of professionalism &amp; editorial integrity, then it breaks RT's rules

@RottenTomatoes Another happy stat: in the history of Rotten Tomatoes, only 4 films remain a 100% with over 100 reviews, and two of them (Lady Bird, Things to Come) are directed by women
Greta Gerwig‚Äôs #LadyBird (100%, 161 reviews) is only 3 Fresh reviews away from topping TOY STORY 2 (100%, 163 reviews) to become the film w/ the most reviews at 100% in @RottenTomatoes history. https://t.co/HCJNFboksg
And I love how the movie ends leaving you teary-eyed, yes, but hopeful. Hopeful that even when there‚Äôs darkness in the world, people will rally around one another and support one another. Movies like this are important right now. They matter
I have a child who is being bullied at school this year, and it‚Äôs been a bit chaotic in my life, to say the least. I‚Äôm thankful films like WONDER exist that address bullying on a level that kids can understand and relate to
I‚Äôve seen critics come at WONDER for being sappy &amp; emotionally exploitive, but I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. I think it speaks to families in ways that incite honest &amp; important conversations
Received a screener of #Wonder, but went back to watch it again on the big screen with my crew. Huge applause at the end, and I still can‚Äôt make it through the ‚ÄúOur Town‚Äù scene without soaking my shirt in tears. Just a sweet movie w/ great messages https://t.co/4cVcU55buj
@GermainLussier I‚Äôm not surprised by the movement - dude did release an extended cut for BvS, so I could see how fans might think another extended cut exists here. They should just tack on some footage for the Blu-ray &amp; call it a day

@SteveKornfeld I actually like how they hid Superman from the marketing. I give WB credit - they are probably the most protective studio when it comes to spoilers. They also hid a lot w/ Blade Runner 2049 too. It may hurt them sometimes, but I respect that about them
@Trevor56510778 I agree
For a positive box office story, see #Wonder ($27mil) and check out both #LadyBird (2.5m) and #ThreeBillboards ($1.1m), the latter two on over 2,000 less screens than the 7 films above them https://t.co/WE9oKhmyg9

#JusticeLeague is better than BvS and #SuicideSquad - it's lean, mean &amp; packed w/ superhero action. I dug most of its lighter moments &amp; I think it has one of the best action sequences ever in a DCEU movie. And of course Wonder Woman steals the show. https://t.co/rW3UjpBUMk

@smacberry @DarrenAronofsky I do not think there is any one message in this film. Yes, JL is very obviously mother earth, but I think its themes speak to all creation
@msvaleriaisabel It's my favorite story -- good luck with the film!
This is my favorite thing @RealGDT has ever done. I love all of his work, but this film is something really, really special
@MusgoHBA For sure
THE SHAPE OF WATER: a sweet, romantic &amp; meticulously beautiful fairytale about the risks we take for the love we long for. I adored it

Moral of the story is you never know when your life will change forever. Sometimes you're just shopping for a backpack in Target...
Now her kid - the red head in the pic above - is in one of the best films of the year AND nailed my favorite moment in the film
It was the 3rd Target she had been to looking for that Vadar backpack &amp; she almost gave up when Baker approached them in an aisle
She almost called security on him and he told her he was casting for a movie and she thought it was a scam.
Spoke to her and her mom tonight. Mom says she was shopping for a Darth Vadar backpack &amp; Baker was stalking them in Target
Favorite behind-the-scenes story at #TIFF is the little girl from THE FLORIDA PROJECT who Sean Baker discovered in a Target in Kissimmee https://t.co/V9XcOAUsOU

First #TIFF movie I walked out of on such a high - it is so friggin' good. Team I, TONYA all the way. Get it into theaters tomorrow!
Allison Janney steals the movie (and will be an Oscar frontrunner), but Margot Robbie is also terrific. Gillespie's best film, hands down
Absolutely loved I, TONYA - shades of Scorsese, the Coens. It's funny, heartbreaking, crazy entertaining. So my jam; fav #TIFF movie so far https://t.co/SdPqlSeaPU

#TIFF https://t.co/rrx7bdxDB6
@kyle_kizu No, Clooney got paid 50k to direct
Clooney also says Oscar Isaac is "the best of that generation that's out there," in terms of actors.
Other Clooney fun bites: He refers to the Coen bros. as "the boys," says original script for this film was called "What Jack Saw"
Films other people won't make. He doesn't need the money; doesn't need to play "the bad guy in a Transformers movie."
He'd like it for people to dig his movies, but if they don't it won't stop him from continually taking risks on films he believes in
Big takeaway is that Clooney is just doing the projects he wants w/ the people he wants. Only took 50k to make Suburbicon
Clooney told the best Oscars story too - way too long for Twitter - about a secret meeting between actors the night before the show
On Suburbicon, fun fact: Josh Brolin played a crazy baseball coach but was cut because it didn't match tonally. Orig script was way goofier
Clooney also says he likes being the guy making the movies no one else will make. Admits some will hit, others will fail. Is what it is
Clooney says he used to read 2-3 scripts a week, now it's 1-2 every couple of months. Wants another Michael Clayton or The Descendants
Was just in a 50-min convo w/ George Clooney, at #TIFF for #Suburbicon. He's definitely not running for office; maybe not acting much either
Finally nabbed a copy of the highly sought after BACKWARDS &amp; IN HEELS at #TIFF.

@ThatJacqueline For Johnny it's less about teaching Daniel than it is about getting back at Kreese, who embarrassed him and played him like a fool
@ThatJacqueline But he is - Johnny is way more experienced in Karate than Daniel. And him returning on the opposing side of Kreese completes his arc
@ThatJacqueline It was all video'd I think, so maybe one day we'll have to post it, even though I'm the one who's right üòâ
@ThatJacqueline I said they should have Rock 3'd it with Miyagi dying midway thru &amp; Johnny stepping in as mentor. @ThatJacqueline strongly disagreed
All I remember from last night was that @ThatJacqueline and I fought for way too long over what the plot of Karate Kid 3 should've been
"Finally a Star Wars package full of toys for girls!" is what the girls in my house shouted upon opening this. üëç

@RottenTomatoes MORE: Add Starkiller Base as a "Death Star" and we're at 82.3%, a slight drop. Remove Force Awakens but add AOTC &amp; it's almost a virtual tie
@mikeryan @GermainLussier @RottenTomatoes AOTC wasn't included in the original gathering - on the fence about it, but we'll run it with and without. ROTS is included
Fun Fact: #StarWars movies that feature the Death Star have an average @RottenTomatoes score of 84.25% vs 76.5% for those that don't https://t.co/2tGQc8OA4x

@GCMcCannMovies Likely read it later this week or early next week
So don't expect some 20-min monologue about some girl some dude has back home. No time for that. It's all go! go! go! Now RUN!
I liked that, tho. In this situation, soldiers &amp; rescuers were all thrown together. No one really knew anyone. It was all about survival
The thing about this film is it very consciously veers away from character development. It's very in-the-moment kinda filmmaking.
Re: #Dunkirk, I had a great chat w/ Nolan last night, actually, and we went deep on one of my favorite scenes, and lots more. Stay tuned...
I saw #Dunkirk in IMAX 70 mm, and if you want the best possible experience of watching this film, you need to see it that way, hands down https://t.co/ARQCJazMLg
@GCMcCannMovies Realistic is an understatement, he went all in on this. I spoke to him about the lack of R-rated grisly warfare &amp; why he stayed away from it
From direction to editing to cinematography to score, w/ #Dunkirk Christopher Nolan proves he is one of the great filmmakers of our time
30 seconds in, Nolan once again delivers a spectacular edge-of-your-seat opening sequence. And then it just keeps upping the tension

@ManaByte @toothlessbum It's a 90 minute panel, and Marvel will want the mic drop. That's how they roll. It'll be a show, no doubt, regardless of D23
At Comic Con, they call it a "sizzle" - trust, there's no way they don't drop something. Guardians showed a sizzle 12 days into production https://t.co/QUffgsxPE7
If I were to guess, I bet it ends with the entire Infinity War cast taking the stage with the drop of the first trailer https://t.co/oXtN0OYlOk
@movie_hangover For sure, it elevates the movie in such a major way
@Reaps11 I meant debut as in its opening weekend
$120 mil would give it the second highest debut (domestic) for a Spider-Man movie. Only Spider-Man 3 ($151 mil) tops that https://t.co/HWXMRPIdin

@GermainLussier @Sean_OConnell Davis was in there last year - that was even bigger
@mccrabb_will Waiting for hope
Not in the Jon Watts piece I'm doing is him saying he visited the #AvengersInfinityWar set recently. His reaction: "It's gonna be crazy."
@ThatJacqueline I don't think so, it doesn't look like it's hitting his face
@mikeryan I bought he Ghostbusters II soundtrack on cassette, so I can relate

@thefilmcynic I can top it - when I was there last year my kid got a nasty case of head lice
@thefilmcynic Now post a selfie 10 hours from now so we can see if you're still smiling
@jackcox997 Poorly worded title, didn't mean to make it sound like he owned the trilogy, just that he is moving on from one trilogy to maybe another
@Darrellict I should've put it in all caps

https://t.co/n6KUEhP4sE https://t.co‚Ä¶
@ScottWamplerBMD @GermainLussier @AshCrossan @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty Please ask to speak with Harry himself if possible. He's the only one who knows it all
@ThatJacqueline Awesome, hope you have a great day!
@ScottWamplerBMD @GermainLussier @AshCrossan @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty I believe it was his first day on the job, the day we got there
@ThatJacqueline Happy B-day, yo! Drinks on me next time I see ya... so, next week?
@ScottWamplerBMD @GermainLussier @AshCrossan @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty Wasn't it his first day on the job, though, and we had like 15 people who all wanted separate checks. That's brutal
@GermainLussier @AshCrossan @ScottWamplerBMD @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty This poor waiter in Orlando has no idea how much he comes up in Twitter convos
@horasperdidas Yes, I have already added it to my watch list.
But then I tossed him one he hadn't seen: The Last American Virgin. An all-timer for me &amp; the best ending. Always love touting that one
Jon Watts &amp; I spoke a lot about coming-of-age movies in our chat, &amp; he tossed one out that I actually haven't seen: L√©olo. It sounds amazing
@elmayimbe @GermainLussier @colliderfrosty I like the cheaper version that involves a group text and the name of a local bar
@edgarwright Oh, it doesn't have to be in any way - I was just joking. Definitely down for more, though.

Agreed - and good hanging with you last night, Rob! https://t.co/SmQFlklhvy
Still VERY early for Spidey, but 96% places it as the highest rated live action superhero movie ever. It'll likely drop, but great start https://t.co/2owo526J1r
@GermainLussier @bangeleno Oh I hit every one of those food trucks
@mymayabee @TalkCrude I think if you like The Fifth Element and that bold, colorful type of unfamiliar sci-fi, then you'll dig it.
@GermainLussier @bangeleno p.s. The pizza in the back was pretty bomb

@JasonGuerrasio Plenty but I live in the NOW
The cool thing about this summer is that Baby Driver, The Big Sick, Spidey, Apes &amp; Wonder Woman are all movies that live up to the hype https://t.co/oy4VZJzqws
@mikeryan The spinoff, yeah
Not that spectacle isn't still important - it'll always be important. But they're leaning more into character &amp; some are really benefiting
LOGAN, SPIDEY, APES &amp; even the BUMBLEBEE movie - I like how we're trending toward smaller-scale character-driven blockbusters over spectacle https://t.co/VnhVhBhtUn
By next month, #WonderWoman will likely overtake GUARDIANS VOL. 2 at the box office to become summer's biggest moneymaker domestically https://t.co/FmPncJTLeM
@Darrellict @GermainLussier I may actually see you tomorrow D üòâ
@kumailn Other films debuted on 4 screens with more money, but most of those also earned Oscar nods. So see the film &amp; get it some Oscar nods!
@GermainLussier @Darrellict @SD_Comic_Con Just landed actually
Since 2013, when it comes to films that opened on 5 screens, only LA LA LAND (14 Oscar nods) debuted w/ more than @kumailn's #TheBigSick https://t.co/X1bVFJ0xHR

@pj_campbell @robertliefeld @shawnxmadden @mikeamessina ...only Spidey is in Marvel Studios' MCU
@pj_campbell @robertliefeld @shawnxmadden @mikeamessina I will transcribe the full quote shortly and put it up but she essentially said that while they are ALL Marvel comics characters....
Pascal said she was itching to clarify that after the story this week. Those other movies will not take place in the MCU
FYI: Just spoke w/ Amy Pascal &amp; Kevin Feige who clarified that Venom, Black Cat, etc are in the Marvel comics universe but not the MCU
Just talked about #SpiderManHomecoming on @CBSNewYork w/ @AndreaGrymesTV &amp; now it's time to dig in w/ the folks who made it. Stay tuned... https://t.co/LGvIz2Yk0H
@mattsinger This is a good tweet, but is it a fun tweet?
@VogtRoberts Early March don't count for summer! But I do think Logan/Kong is the year's best back-to-back so far
Guardians, Wonder Woman, Baby Driver, Big Sick, Spider-Man, Apes - all great, entertaining movies. I'm down with this summer so far...
And I'll toss out one more thing - ya got 2 post-credits scenes, so stick around. The second one is so good
#SpidermanHomecoming
@Darrellict It's so well written and all the comic timing is terrific. Maybe one of the best Marvel scripts yet I'd say
@Darrellict C'mon DB - those CA videos are so great
Oh, and the biggest MCU scene stealer is not Tony Stark üòâ
Spot on casting, spot on Spidey - the audience had a blast. My 18 year old nephew says it's "spectacular" &amp; his favorite Marvel film yet
My favorite thing about this Spidey film is that it was so outer-boro NY. Queens, Brooklyn &amp; Staten Island represent!!!
#SpiderManHomecoming is SUCH a good time. Fun, inventive action w/ some of the best humor in a Marvel film yet. Great start for MCU Spidey! https://t.co/8kTnG6wtO2

I've been lucky enough to speak to a bunch of filmmakers w/ major summer movies this year, but this chat was by far my longest.
Earlier this week I had a chance to interview someone I've always wanted to talk to. I was nervous but it turned out to be a fantastic convo
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES began screening last night in LA and I hear it's tremendous. I see it Weds - can't wait! https://t.co/FNMuQ68CIE
@connieshih I thought JW was harmless and BoH is the farthest thing from Star Wars - they are in a different universe of moviemaking.
As Trevorrow has said himself, he has a massively talented team at his disposal. Hence, it isn't The Book of Henry
Wow I didn't realize people would be so vile towards the dude. What I meant was Star Wars is a completely different situation
Star Wars fans shouldn't be concerned because The Book of Henry isn't a Star Wars movie üòâ https://t.co/TAWhpV8FeR

@mattsinger Cannot wait to watch this -- missed it at Tribeca
@pardonater I think if a movie works, it works as a whole, and knowing lines or plot points should not hinder the experience of watching it
Personally I watch a ton of trailers, but I'm not as bothered by spoilers. I just love trailers. But if you want to go in clean, go in clean
@loveofcinemasf8 Then don't complain! Ha!
I always laugh when people complain that too much of a movie is spoiled in its trailers. Here's an idea - don't watch the trailers then!

I actually liked what the "It" was and thought it was refreshing that a film didn't just give us what we were expecting based on its trailer https://t.co/ITLOngU0aJ
@Koutchboom Nope
@blumhouse Also: I believe this is about a girl who must relive the same day over &amp; over until she figures out who is trying to kill her.
Okay, you have my attention...
(p.s. This is a @blumhouse joint) https://t.co/TsQSrXqvEG
@TheSpencerPerry Yeah THE WITCH had similar issues. Both are more psychological thrillers &amp; I think audiences were expecting more monster-ish stuff
@Chris_Laudando I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so just trying to speak generally about it
Only thing I can chalk it up to (cause it's a very good film) is that audiences were expecting something different w/ a bigger payoff
Since 1998, IT COMES AT NIGHT is the best-reviewed film (86%) to receive less than a ‚ÄúC-‚Äú Cinemascore. The divide on this one is odd...
@mattsinger I don't understand this scandal -- isn't the whole point of this show is that people hook up?

@PastTenseOfJav I am a huge Taika fan, and think he's brilliant. Was just listing directors who went from small budgeted films to blockbusters.
@jtanner79 I'd say so, more unsettling tho. I know I keep using that word, but it really is the best way to describe the feeling of watching this film
This movie is so unsettling. Just so, so unsettling, and a pretty masterful psychological thriller. https://t.co/zWR4SN3LgF
@jhoffman It's super unsettling horror
@fangirlJeanne @Msblerdess @Fandango I'm a huge fan of Taika - I think he's brilliant. Just pointing out directors who went from smaller budgeted movies to big ones.

@katerbland @JasonGuerrasio I remember when @mikeryan &amp; I interviewed Joel Kinnaman at comic con and he was vaping. First time I had ever seen that during an interview
@THR Like, how an indie director is on the verge of debuting one of the best reviewed superhero films of all time. Let's see that angle more
P.S. I don't mean to bash @THR as these "gamble" stories did exist before WW. Would just prefer a fresher narrative 
https://t.co/UQLbbMiWm9
@Filmdrunk @selashiloni Maybe you're right - tried searching for Jurassic World, didn't find one. But curious to see the angle taken on all those other movies
Or remember when Disney gambled their third THOR sequel on some quirky New Zealander whose previous film cost $1.6 million?? https://t.co/XkQc5JBYPR
Or remember when Sony gambled $230 million on a SPIDER-MAN reboot on an indie director whose previous film cost $7.5 million? https://t.co/XkQc5JBYPR
Or remember when Universal gambled $150 million on a JURASSIC PARK sequel on some indie director whose previous film was made for $750,000?? https://t.co/XkQc5Jknrh

@joshuarshultz I disagree, I don't always agree with the average critic score but I agree with it more than I don't agree with it
@jhoffman I think it's still a superhero movie. I think Scream, for example, is still a horror movie
Also, at 97%, Wonder Woman is tied with The Incredibles for best reviewed superhero movie ever, period.

Can't get into spoilers, but I will say the relationship/chemistry between Gadot and Pine is my favorite part of the movie. https://t.co/c8bFolQy7w
I would say, yes. Keep in mind there is some WWI imagery that may be a little scary for young ones (gas masks, etc). 
#WonderWoman https://t.co/0s3PbjuJhP
@Shaun_Wren It has a refreshing fish-out-of-water element that is really fun to watch play out

Great to see all the positive #WonderWoman reactions. The movie strikes a terrific balance b/t action, adventure, humor &amp; romance. Not easy https://t.co/hOOootvrDo
WONDER WOMAN is great. My favorite of the recent DC movies. It's fierce, funny, well-written and badass. @GalGadot owns it. Her lasso FTW https://t.co/rQ0ufZxWXP

Molly Haskell doesn't think of Hollywood movies as films, they are product. She's not worried abt lack of women in that structure. #CUFF2015

Will movie theaters exist in 25 yrs? Cinemas will survive as clubs. Fests will too. Multiplexes won't, says Schrader. Biskind disagrees.

@simbolism1 I honestly have no idea.
@Chris_Tonick I can. I worked there in 1998 and it was a toxic waste dump.
Like, I spent spent so much time squinting at current and faded child stars wearing sweatpants in Gelson's that his looks don't look odd to me at all. But I can't prove it. There was no paparazzi then. I went on Getty and searched "Gelson's" and only got photos of soccer.
As a native of Studio City, the recent fascination with Shia's "off duty" fashion taps into a weird free-floating nostalgia for me that I have a hard time putting into words. I feel like he falls into a great tradition that was the wallpaper of my life from the mid-80s-late-90s.

It's very exciting that @UCLAFTVArchive is screening Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead on March 12! One of preteen Karina's favorite films. I rewatched it a couple of years ago and was stunned by how well it held up/how good it is. Applegate's character/performance=A++++

@andrewsampson_ I haven't seen it yet. I don't really believe that films get "snubbed" in most categories (the Academy is not getting together and deciding to exclude films). But nominees in this category are chosen by a committee, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@becroll Haven't seen it yet. They showed a terrible trailer at the theater where I saw Loveless last weekend.
...that it succeeds as much as it does is pretty remarkable. &lt;/end Oscar Thoughts&gt;
But it's now clear to me that what The Square is trying to do is so much more ambitious than what any other film in the category is trying to do, and it's attempting to grapple with so many ideas, and even though I still don't think it's batting 1.000...
There are good movies nominated; I only really disliked one of them, and I probably most enjoyed watching On Body and Soul.
Basically, I saw The Square first, months ago, and didn't totally get it, and was frankly more annoyed by it than impressed. Then I watched every other movie in the category.

.@Phantom_Thread was/is my favorite movie of 2017. It's out today everywhere. Go see it!
@mimbale My sense from being around voting people in LA is that no one is watching it. There's still the idea that a Netflix movie isn't "real" -- no one is watching the Baumbach movie or Okja for awards consideration, either.
@FilmFan1971 Is that inaccurate? I don't remember the details of Hedy's story very well, but I don't remember her being paid for the invention that she patented. She attempted to donate it to the US government during the war.

@antkaufman ...its genre has basically been relegated to TV.
@antkaufman It totally is meant as a compliment! I think Mudbound is an excellent example of what is wrongly looked down on as a "low" genre, the romantic, historic social issue melodrama. If it's a criticism at all it's just that Mudbound feels kind of like TV, but maybe that's because...
For those on the edge of your seats: I went to see The Square &amp; watched Mudbound on Netflix. I preferred Mudbound. It reminded me of my fave Hallmark Channel movie, in which Felicity is arranged married to Skeet Ulrich, solves Japanese internment https://t.co/mx9XPPuZY7 https://t.co/iCaXVMfXaS
@vernlien I saw them on the Terror Twilight tour in Chicago and it was a fun show. Maybe because they thought they weren't going to have to do it for much longer?
@sleezsisters The two together kind of turned me off to live music. It just felt like, "We're all too old for this."
@sleezsisters I think so. I guess it was the first reunion tour/promoting the greatest hits CD. It was a few months after I had gone to my one and only Pixies show which was even more "businesslike" and depressing.

@marclamb *shrug* I liked it better than season 3
@brightidea21 @RememberThisPod I promise you I'm working very hard on the new podcast season. Sometimes I have to take a five minute break to think about something else.
@craigtminami Honestly, my single father's weeknight dinner repertoire was 75% Gelson's ready-to-cook:  turkey meatloaf, turkey meatballs, chicken fajitas
As someone who has spent most of my life living near them, I am deeply Gelson's brand loyal, and I just hoped for better representation.
...but they clearly didn't shoot it at that Gelson's, and the exterior is not the UCB on Franklin. Missed opportunity for LA authenticity!
But instead, she's apparently going to the Gelson's on Franklin near Beachwood Canyon, bc she walks out of it and into UCB, which, fine...
...because they have a wine bar! And from walking past it on my way to shop, it seems like it has a late-in-life singles scene!
If Joshy lives in Silverlake,as we've been told he does, his mom would be going to the Silverlake Gelson's, which would have been perfect...
I love Transparent, but in season four I'm troubled by its inaccurate depiction of something that means a lot to me: Gelson's.

@KennyJive @RememberThisPod Why would you tweet this?
@brooksbarnesNYT Thanks for mentioning @RememberThisPod in your @TandCmag story on Fonda! But, Jean &amp; Jane was the 9th season, not the 3rd
I feel like the idea that this just what powerful men do needs to be eroded, and the way to do that is by being very specific, not general
Of course this has always happened in Hollywood. But to couch HW's crimes as, like,mogul tradition feels like it undercuts his specific evil
Like, comparing Weinstein to past, sexually abusive moguls puts him in a canon of "great men," and sort of lets him off the hook.
The more I think about it, the "this has been happening for 100 years/Harvey is just like Darryl Zanuck" argument gives HW too much credit https://t.co/BIYexzGu0E

Also, this week I'm going to be a guest on one of my favorite podcasts, talking about a pleasure over which I feel no guilt whatsoever.
There are three #DeadBlondes episodes left of @rememberthispod. This is the outro song of one of them: https://t.co/hmwrp6sJYo
@Graham_Fuller @RulesDontApply @CultureTripENT @CultureTrip @EWeitzman @TravelEditorNik @IsStevens @james___bell @carynjames @szacharek Caught is pretty incredible. I loved Rules but see it as a movie about Beatty as much as it is about Hughes
@marcik @RememberThisPod I first read about her when I was researching the MGM series.
@K_Poirier2 I don't usually like to give hints or info about future topics, but I can say next week's subject is the opposite of Anna Nicole Smith.
@MihajlovicIgor Not soon, but maybe someday!
The subject of this week's episode! https://t.co/xUJ2z4F0Di
@rickburin That's from a film in this week's episode!
It would be great to add streaming info in the future, but b/c availability/streaming rights change frequently would be hard to keep updated https://t.co/vnsjEQMCaE

@paulandstorm: i have no idea. But I think Bullworth is excellent, so.
@carterradams sometimes it feels like he's capturing the essence of Hughes. Sometimes it feels like he's revealing Warren Beatty.
Rules Don't Apply was prob never going to be a blockbuster but opening it on 2000+ theaters was insane.
@annoyingworld yes but you can't let that (or any of the other issues of willful manipulating of the historical record) bother you.
Disappointing that the narrative on Rules Don't Apply will be that it "bombed." It's prob Beatty's least great film but I still loved it.

@connorland2: in part b/c many women in power in the industry still have to cede to men &amp; female audiences are ghettoized/underestimated
@connorland2: its less important for movies to present a fantasy of female power,but they're more derelict in reflecting actual female power
@connorland2: but more commonly actresses were women whose lives weren't entirely their own, playing fantasies of power/independence/freedom
@connorland2: the exceptions were big stars like Joan Crawford who had costar approval, or K Hepburn who acted as an (uncredited) producer
@connorland2: back then there was a contradiction btwn powerful images of women on-screen and the lack of power those women had off-screen

You could replace the vegetables with pasta! No wonder you'd then need a spanking.
I'm not kidding about the noodles. Like for lunch, she'd recommend broth, a broiled lamb chop and a spoonful of spinach OR buttered noodles.
RT @selfstyledsiren: @KarinaLongworth Madame Sylvia was SO not selling diets.
Now you know.
Anyway, Madame Sylvia's "method" involved a lot of buttered noodles, and she'd basically spank her clients in the spots they wanted to slim.
It could only have been more embarrassing for me if anyone had know that this was, in fact, an instructive diet book.
The librarian couldn't go get it himself, so he had to make a phone call and say "Hollywood Undressed" aloud in the silent library.
Yesterday at the library I filled out a form to request a book called "Hollywood Undressed" by Madame Sylvia, a '20s diet guru to the stars.

Today's research is pretty gross, guys! Increasingly seems clear that the "sexual revolution" was 1 of top 5 worst eras for women in Hwood
@theericlarson: Also,most songs are listed on show notes for each ep's post at http://t.co/jH42ngjtp3, except for some royalty free tracks
@theericlarson: if you can give me approximate time stamp I'll find the specific track.
I was just told there are no full electrical outlets in any bathroom in UK, &amp; thus hairdryers require extension cords. Was I being trolled?
@BrianBurkart: thanks! You can follow the pod @RememberThisPod
This is probably my favourite Dennis Wilson song: https://t.co/X3ffbHfmz4
@DrGMLaTulippe: yeah I can't join you there üòÅ But anyone with that track record should have the freedom to misfire occasionally.
@DrGMLaTulippe: it's maybe proof that unlike male auteurs who can have half dozen flops, women get one &amp; they're done. Heckerling had LOSER.

(I'm also very worried about Kenley Jansen.)
Anyway! It's fun to tweet personal feelings when America is asleep!
One of the things that makes me feel so sad about the Manson stories is thinking about how these lost girls turned into killer zombies. So.
Also, summer fashion seems to be drifting toward the scruffy pole of "boho." I walk around &amp; feel surrounded by high-fashion Manson girls.
Has researching Charles Manson on/off for 6 months/ intensely for 6 weeks gotten to me? Yes, probably. I've been feeling not super cheerful.

People are scared. We all get that. Behavior that was acceptable is now out of bounds. Things people have kept pent up inside them for decades is flooding out and this is changing our world. There will be push back at all corners precisely because the stakes are so high.

He is VILE.
The gall of Weinstein to actually use the words of Streep and also Jennifer Lawrence who were not abused by him to refute the women were abused by him is INFURIATING. He is trying to dismiss a class action lawsuit and is basically saying- see, I didn't harass or abuse every woman
"The criminal actions he is accused of conducting on the bodies of these women are his responsibility, and if there is any justice left in the system he will pay for them ‚Äî regardless of how many good movies, made by many good people, Harvey was lucky enough to have acquired..."
Meryl Streep:
"Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs attorneys‚Äô use of my (true) statement ‚Äî that he was not sexually transgressive or physically abusive in our business relationship ‚Äî as evidence that he was not abusive with many OTHER women is pathetic and exploitive,"

@riceunderwater @BBC I'm not even 100% sure of which show I was interviewed for. It was radio and I think I heard them mention Manchester. Sorry.
Last thought on this for today. Uma Thurman is on Broadway now. She has 2 performances today. She is in every scene. Imagine going on stage today having had this article come out. That's guts. I really hope someone gets her flowers.
we all need to let women feel and rage because that rage has been pent up for decades if not centuries. The struggle is to find a new vocabulary for how we move forward. No one has the answer right now. And that is scary. But this is our new reality. No more silence.
And people who want the world to go back to what it was where women were bullied into silence should just forget it. There is a before and an after. There is no going back. We need to keep amplifying women's voices. We need to keep believing women and

Just did a @BBC radio interview where the presenter was asking about whether it was confusing that #UmaThurman discussed both HW and Tarantino in the same piece. I don't find it confusing. The allegations against both are different. Both have impacted her greatly and she

I agree that it would have been better that the #UmaThurman piece be a news piece that was reported and not an opinion piece. But I still say that we need to focus on what Uma says, not anything else.
Also, I'm thinking that CAA has not paid enough of a price for its complicity in all of this. The apology is not enough. Who were the agents who did this? Are they still working? This piece of the story just can't be glossed over. https://t.co/RijVG4LJ2X

Every time I read another one of these startling revelations about what women are put through in Hollywood my heart aches. A stupid shot is not as important as someone's life. Reading this piece it feels to me that the climate created by Harvey allowed the recklessness of
‚ÄúHarvey assaulted me but that didn‚Äôt kill me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhat really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot.

‚ÄúI felt this searing pain and thought, ‚ÄòOh my God, I‚Äôm never going to walk again,‚Äô
The incredible thing about this piece is that Harvey actually responds and admits ‚ÄúMr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals in Paris,‚Äù
His definition of a pass is sexual assault.
"Thurman stresses that Creative Artists Agency, her former agency, was connected to Weinstein‚Äôs predatory behavior."
On Harvey: ‚ÄúIt was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things"

One of Hillary knockout punches https://t.co/gWKgN4ZUz6
Once again, Hillary Clinton was under intense pressure and she exceeded anyone's expectation.
Not even Trump surrogates can spin this debate as his win. Donald blew it 30 minutes in.
Hillary uses Trump's mistake insulting her "look" to remind America about his despicable attitude towards women. Yay!
Donald just repeated that Hillary doesn't have "Presidential look." This from Trump trout pout.
Trump has no facts at the ready. Maybe the next debate - if there is a 2nd and 3rd debate and he doesn't wimp out - he'll prepare.
Hillary knows she's won this debate. She needs a touchdown signature dance at the podium.
OK, a ref needs to stop this debate. Trump is now unhinged.
Hillary looks like the cat who just ate the canary when Lester Holt called out Trump for lying about supporting the war in Iraq.
Watch how Trump debates like Pee-wee Herman when she corrects his lies: "Wrong." "Wrong." "Wrong."
Didn't Jimmy Carter get ridiculed for using his daughter Amy as an example? Didn't Trump just do the thing with his son Baron?
Hillary now has Trump defending Russian cyber-attacks? Claiming we don't know who did it? Yes we do: his bromance Putin!
Lester Holt is back in control of this debate and Trump. Finally!
Donald Trump is too sick to be President. He keeps snorting.
Yes! Hillary hits Trump with "his long record of engaging in racist behavior" by making him defend his refusal to rent to blacks.
Knock-out punch by Hillary that she prepared for this debate and is prepared for the Presidency.
Hillary just mentioned mental health and should add: "Donald, you're the result of Republicans cutting mental health funding for decades."
Trump just got fact-checked by Lester H
Hillary, ask Trump how he would know about black lives since he doesn't go into 'those areas' and wouldn't rent to 'those people'
Hillary, please hit Trump on his bankruptcies!
All those psychological studies Hillary and her team consulted to get under Trump's skin was time well spent. He's on defensive.
Wow, Hillary has Trump on the ropes. He's feeling forced to give a commercial for his D.C. hotel.
Hillary is really getting under Trump's skin by attacking his wealth and his business debts and his unpaid workers.
The Trump trout pout. He looks like a petulant little boy who's angry and flailing and gonna cry.
Hillary just landed a huge punch to Trump about why he's not releasing his tax returns. Gotcha!
Trump is starting to sound like he's at one of his rallies: shouting, lying, bullying. Ugh.
Trump is saying anything that comes into his head: "Hillary has been fighting Isis all of her adult life." On what planet?
Lester Holt has lost control of this debate 25 minutes in. By allowing Trump to constantly interrupt her with his lies.
"Donald, I know you live in your own reality." Good line!
Was that Trump's hand shaking as he takes slug after slug of water? Isn't that what Donald insulted 'Little Marco' for?
So Trump is going to ignore Lester Holt? And act condescending to Hillary?
Hillary hits Trump early on. By raising the $14 million which his father loaned him. He looked like she hit him in the jaw.

Nothing more needs to be said. The Devil tells The Donald: 'I approve of your speech.' https://t.co/8gIcugHtcU
The second-to-last person in U.S. capable of improving race relations is Donald Trump. Last person? David Duke.
So media says Donald Trump‚Äôs hour and 15 minute speech tonight is the longest by any nominee in 40 years. Stop him before he speaks again.
Donald Trump should be saying 'my sole and exclusive mission' is to keep avoiding taxes and hurting immigrants, minorities and women. Ugh!
Don't you love how Donald Trump only talks about pulpits and Christmas as if non-Christian religions don't exist?
It's clear that Donald Trump isn't on a diet for verbiage tonight (or for anything else).
Just hearing Donald Trump say the words 'my first 100 days' in office sent a shiver down my spine. Too scary...
Actually, Donald Trump has proposed the largest tax decrease for millionaires and billionaires like himself.
Why doesn't Donald Trump start by reforming his and Ivanka's own trade deals since they manufacture in China?
If Donald Trump wins the election, the first thing on his agenda will be redecorating the White House with gold leaf
And when Donald Trump refuses to debate her, Hillary Clinton should just debate a chair onstage. Same as his IQ.
I predict Donald Trump will avoid debating Hillary just like he avoided releasing his taxes.

Donald Trump claims he'll 'ensure kids are treated and protected equally.'  Unless they're brown, black, yellow, immigrant, muslim, female.
The very idea that Donald Trump is telling workers 'I am your voice' must be a joke. He just won't pay them after the work is actually done.
Yes, Donald, nobody knows how to GAME the U.S. system with using bankruptcies and ignoring contracts and not paying taxes better than you!
Hillary withstood grilling before Congress for 11 hours. Donald Trump whined that a 3-hour debate with 17 GOP candidates was too long.
When Donald Trump says 'I am the voice,' he's the voice only for the Aryan nation. No blacks, browns, yellows, native or immigrant, allowed.
But, Donald Trump, you're now begging for and accepting big money from special interests who are pulling your strings!
How can Donald Trump have reached this point in the electoral process without being pushed to provide specifics on any policy positions?
After his incomprehensible NATO policies espoused again and again, we know now what Donald Trump would do overseas: abandon U.S. allies.
So this is Donald Trump's big RNC theme: 'Law &amp; Order'? On what planet when he and his staff can't even run an unchaotic convention?
'These are the facts.' Facts? No politician this election has needed more fact-checking which has exposed more lies than Donald Trump.
Donald Trump's use of the word 'humbly' seems most unnatural. Like telling the truth when he prefers to tell lies.
'Who would have believed?' says Donald Trump tonight. Certainly only the racist and bigoted.

No surprise hyper-ambitious Dean Baquet replaces Jill Abramson atop NYTimes. He even publicly dissed her as "a bitchy woman character".
Anna Wintour's awful Kim-Kanye cover only sold less-than-average 250,000 newsstand copies - not the 500,000 previously hyped.
Why NYTimes sucks: This home page blurb on Moms Day - 'I was not alone with the guilty secret of having wished my aged mother dead.'
@neologismist - Journalism is what I do. Powerless to resist. If I had it to do all over again, I'd be badass homicide detective.
Now that Anna Wintour has become Kim Kardashian's bitch, this sell-out editor is past her expiration date at Vogue and Cond√© Nast.
I'm loving the big backlash aimed at Anna Wintour for putting Kim Kardashian on Vogue cover. Issue should come with barf bag.
Damn, I should have taken an iPhone photo of Graydon Carter sitting in my L.A. living room last Wednesday at 3 PM.

http://t.co/9bRAXkNVj6. My news he quit 
http://t.co/cVgA6AZo7C.
R.I.P. Peter Kaplan, contd: In today's journalism, reporting is often stenography. But Peter demanded all NYO stories have a point of view.
R.I.P. Peter Kaplan, contd: He would have killed to be The New Yorker editor, the perfect outlet for him, but too proud to campaign hard.
R.I.P. Peter Kaplan, the former New York Observer editor-in-chief. Here is what I wrote when he stepped down: http://t.co/zXmU0jP50A
Peter Kaplan was my most inspirational editor. "Write what you know." "Don't leave anything off the page." "You're best when you're angry."
I keep reading and re-reading the NYT obituary for Peter Kaplan, the brilliant New York Observer, not wanting to believe it.
Isn't a magazine defrauding readers and advertisers by pretending to have recent photos of me when in fact the magazine faked the photos?
I said it: ‚ÄúI just think of sitting at 2 AM, chuckling to myself, writing what I consider to be the truth, and just having fun."
I said it: ‚ÄúBeing powerful in H'wood was everyone else‚Äôs characterization of me. I only cared about telling unvarnished truth about H'wood.‚Äù

@KrisLongfield The mpaa likes to hide the real numbers in a visual presentation that makes it look much better than it is.
@KrisLongfield Actually it does say that 11% of the us/ca population (346.4 million) are frequent moviegoers, so that number is 38.1 million people.

What if Avengers 4 ends with Cap back in the past, reunited with Peggy and his ending is being returned to the past to live the rest of his days. It‚Äôs a way to remove him from the current era without killing him, allowing the possibility for Evans to come back down the line.
For anyone freaking out over Chris Evans saying Avengers 4 is his last marvel movie, remember that this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean what you might think it could mean. I think marvels too crafty to allow him to spoil caps ending to the masses...

@richardrushfield Just because it can be done doesn‚Äôt make it the better version of the story.
@richardrushfield Personally I loved the first seasons of Fargo and Westworld and would not want to see the four hour versions of those stories.
@richardrushfield I just think they have the length of a season too long. 8-10 is good. And on streaming there is no reason why every episode should be 1 hour long. The story should dictate the length of an episode. These aren‚Äôt airing on a grid so why comply to the standards of old tech?

@alexreino Ha, I optimistically think it will and am often times proven wrong.

@pafifi ‚Ä¶whole exercise. If we are going to spend 5 days on a set visit, we need to make it worth it for our site, as a business, and worth it to our readers as well.
@pafifi I can confirm for you that the studios don‚Äôt care about how many quantity of articles we produce. They only care for one. Some outlets only do one. We would get invited back with one piece. But many less people would read the coverage and we‚Äôd make much less money from the‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶insight into the process, and why things happen the way they do in terms of set visit coverage. If you have any questions about it, I‚Äôd be happy to answer them here.
‚Ä¶worth it from a business perspective. This is how this business works. Studios do not pay sites for coverage, as far as I‚Äôve ever seen in 12 years of doing this. People who think otherwise don‚Äôt understand the economics of this business. I hope these tweets gives you some‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ interesting stories that those who might not read a 4,000 word 30 minute long interview might want to read about. Because honestly, not all readers want to read a long interview transcript. And honestly, the traffic for said transcript would not make the many days of effort‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶This is how it works. Doing a set visit is a tremendous time investment, from two long plane flights, to being on set and unavailable to do normal movie news coverage on the site, to many hours of transcription and write-up. To make our efforts worth it we break out‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶or so outlets got the same interviews, we all run it at the same time. If we didn‚Äôt, the coverage would be available elsewhere. This is why when a set visit embargo break happens you see a lot of coverage from it on our site, or any movie site who was on the visit.

@GermainLussier @KofiOutlaw Even from an expectstions standpoint, knowing they aren‚Äôt in the movie can only increase your enjoyment and lower your disappointment. It definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt your experience of the story.
@KofiOutlaw @GermainLussier I define spoiler as something that spoils the enjoyment of the story itself. This is not in that spoiler and expectations of it are not in the marketing.
@artoo_tweetoo Not really because this is pointing out something actually in the film. These are in the film not at all, not referenced, mentioned, hinted at.
@GermainLussier We choose extreme caution with spoilers, but I don‚Äôt believe this is one in any definition of the word. But we are running circles. Bottom line is we have spoiled nothing for anyone.
@GermainLussier But that‚Äôs a lie to something that actually happens in the film.
@GermainLussier Again, that‚Äôs not the definition of a spoiler. Anyways, I think going in with clearer expectations would only lead to less disappointment and more enjoyment.
@GermainLussier ...oh damn something I think they are leading to isn‚Äôt going to be that because I read that headline. It has no effect on your enjoyment of the story and thus by definition is not a spoiler. If you want to go in unsullied, that‚Äôs another thing entirely.
@GermainLussier I don‚Äôt think it takes a ya from any possibilities in the movie because it‚Äôs never eluded to that there is an infinity stone in the movie what so ever. At no point in this story will someone who is seeing the film for the first time be like...
@perforada The point is you knowing about something that doesn‚Äôt happen in the movie in no way spoils your enjoyment of the film or story whatsoever. It‚Äôs not teased in the marketing or anything. Expectations are not from the film/studio.
@redalert33 I think you misunderstand what spoiler means. Also, just because it doesn‚Äôt appear in the movie doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not in wakanda.
@TheCMH Then don‚Äôt read the internet. Sorry we are not responsible for catering to this level of spoilerphobia.

@MCUjohnnysins Then I saved them disappointment but certainly didn‚Äôt spoil anything in ththe movie.
@MCUjohnnysins Not a spoiler, spoils nothing in the movie what so ever
@Kal_Ed11 Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a spoiler. Spoils nothing in the film at all. It‚Äôs like me saying, iron man isn‚Äôt in the movie.
@MCUjohnnysins When did we post a spoiler ?

@jordanpaley Hmmm looking into this
@Devindra @davechensky Honestly seemed faster before for me, not sure why.
@Devindra @davechensky Mine loaded near instant before. But I also have 350mbs internet
@davechensky Oh, and also fast forwarding in the new app is TERRIBLE. Its painful. Might end up just using my phone now and air playing to Atv.
@davechensky Also, none of these ‚Äúadded features‚Äù are anything I want/need. I just want to be able to navigate through my subscriptions with ease.
@davechensky The previous app was GREAT for my needs. My one complaint is the force-quit thing. This is HORRIBLE. I can barely navigate.

@Cbake1369 @Ethan_Anderton @iamchoppah It‚Äôs not a position in high but a position collaborated by two unrelated people who actually saw the movie itself, that‚Äôs the best we can possibly do. This is the last tweet from me on this matter.
@Cbake1369 @Ethan_Anderton @iamchoppah Respectfully disagree, I would think anybody went to go and totally blind would not read a review or even see a trailer. Our line on spoilers is stricter than 95% of film sites, and we do occasionally do spoiler free reactions for those who want no details.
@Ethan_Anderton @Cbake1369 @iamchoppah For what it‚Äôs worth, we don‚Äôt take this lightly. I have also done the due diligence of talking with another person who saw the movie and they were also under the same belief that it‚Äôs obvious from the start and not a spoiler.

And lets not forget that at least the #XFL was the first to use spydercam during games and cameras on the ground. If they just try to be the NFL they'll fail, they need to differentiate themselves more than they did.
I dont like sports so I'm probably not qualified to offer advice, but I hope the #XFL2020 at very least tries more to make their league very very different from the NFL football.
And actually to be fair, the response was 50% ‚Äúthis is 100% accurate‚Äù and 50% ‚Äúyou guys are smug trolling assholes‚Äù which makes it funnier.
Write anything positive about the MCU and ‚Äúyou guys are getting paid by Disney‚Äù. Write a jokey headline making fun of an MCU set photo and ‚Äúyou guys are smug trolling assholes"

@rianjohnson Ha, thanks Rian. I think you'd agree that just because something has been done previously in Star Wars Canon does not mean it is good storytelling. Nor does this moment resolve the climactic situation.
@OldThinkerTube Ridiculous arguement. There must be a good way of setting it up that does not telegraph the surprise. To say it's not possible is stupid

@mattsinger Saying the connection team to set up is valid point. Doesn‚Äôt seem to add up for me especially because Kylo and Rey continue to share an astral projection after smoke, the one who set up the connection, is killed. Also I don‚Äôt understand how Snoke is able to astral...

@petexnasty @rianjohnson Those fans are stupid. But I think it‚Äôs wrong discount people who might have intelligent criticisms of the film. I love the movie. But I also have some issues which I think are valid.
@NeverOnBrand I have if you questions. 1. how did Snoke supposedly astral project Kylo without killing himself. 2. How does nook know where Ach-to is? 3. Snoke is killed and Yet Kylo/rey share another  connection moment. If this is the same thing why is in either of them killed?
@shawnyflan It does change. Luke would‚Äôve been killed they would‚Äôve gotten to the resistance in stopped the resistance entirely.
@JonnyHanukkah Yes. We recorded entire podcast about this. Feel free to listen to it. Ray and Kylo have astral projection connection after sNike is killed, hows that possible with that one of them dying?

@paulscheer @BrianLynch Honestly it would make sense to involve Strickland‚Äôs kid if the movie was partially about the slacker generation.
@BrianLynch @paulscheer I would have cast Paul as Strickland‚Äôs kid who turned out to be the asshole slacker he always screamed about.
@BrianLynch I‚Äôm confused. Why would Marty and doc be disappearing?
@paulscheer @BrianLynch Correct. But BTTF has established that time travel takes time to fade over (Marty doesn‚Äôt just disappear right away) so you could have the same ticking time plot device of them having to fix it before they are erased from existence.
@BrianLynch @IDWPublishing I‚Äôm pretty sure if you pitched it they would. The comic line has actually been pretty fun.
@BrianLynch Now your mission is to come up with the five best jokes for the movie revolving around doc‚Äôs millennial kids in the 1908s not understanding the differences in the 30 year time gap. ;p

@JakeMckay Also correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I believe Kylo and Rey share a connected moment, which you‚Äôre suggesting is astral projection, after snoke‚Äôs death, so how is that happening?
@JakeMckay So Snoke can do it but it would kill Luke?
@alindsey4 force lightning was not the resolution to the climactic problem.
@EricDSnider @GermainLussier I also don‚Äôt feel comfortable arguing about this openly on twitter as it‚Äôs spoilers (and even though everyone should have seen this film by now...) and a micro format. Would love to chat about it next week at Sundance in person.
@EricDSnider @GermainLussier I don‚Äôt have a problem with buying that Luke can do it. I don‚Äôt have a problem with adding that ability to canon. I just didn‚Äôt think it was setup well. It felt like magic ability we haven‚Äôt clearly seen before is the solution of film‚Äôs climactic moment. But, just my opinion.

@themetaplexcom We‚Äôve seen that before in Star Wars and is clearly not the same thing as this.
@GermainLussier I‚Äôve heard this explanation 100 times, I don‚Äôt believe this is actually a setup for the ending, and if I‚Äôm wrong, I think it‚Äôs too subtle and not effective in that sense.
@alindsey4 ...and the result of the Force power was pivotal to the ending twist, which something like Force lightning wasn‚Äôt.
@alindsey4 Just because it happened before in a movie in this franchise doesn‚Äôt make that instance bad screenwriting. But honestly I‚Äôd argue the Force lightning doesn‚Äôt seem like a big leap from Force chokes...etc. this was very different than any ability we had seen previously...

@eddielosoyajr @rianjohnson @knowsworthy It was. Oniwan had him blinded in the lightsaber training on the falcon, teaching him to trust his instincts.
@Ethan_Anderton @rianjohnson @knowsworthy Suck up ;p
@rianjohnson @knowsworthy Rian, I love the film and not going to argue here but I do believe it‚Äôs different when something is introduced for the first time as part of the resolution of the climax of a movie. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@knowsworthy @rianjohnson In my mind, I don‚Äôt believe these scenes clearly setup up the concept of astral projection. It does set up the idea of that astral projection would result in death. I also don‚Äôt think at messaging a filmmaker into a conversation like this is cool.

Meryl Streep raises the bar on the Globes by taking on Trump without ever mentioning his name, just the scary future he represents.
Tom Hiddleston wins for Night Manager, joining costars Hugh Laurie and Olivia Coleman. A terrific show. But Courtney Vance, you were robbed.
Damien Chazelle wins Globe for his  La La Land screenplay. Love that movie. But Kenneth Lonergan did wonders with Manchester By the Sea.

Inarritu joins John Ford and Joe Mankiewicz as the only directors to win back to back Oscars. But no one has won back to back 4 Best Picture
Oscar ends its 3 hour and 36 minute show with "Fight the Power." I'm assuming that's meant for people of color. A long road ahead.
Much to my joy, Spotlight triumphs over The Revenant for Best Picture. It was a ragged, slog of a show. But the right movie won. Yes!
Leo wins, at last. No surprise. But the fire and intelligence of his acceptance speech, that nailed it.
Brie Larson wins Best Actress for Room. The award was expected by so well and truly earned.
Alejandro Inarritu wins directing Oscar twice in a row. His articulate speech, one of the few worthy of remembering, is cut off w music!
The great Ennio Morricone wins his first scoring Oscar for The Hateful Eight. Talk about what took you so long. Genius.
Sam Smith's meh song from Spectre beats Gaga's anthem from The Hunting Groubd. Wait, what? Are you kidding?
intro'd byJoe Biden, Lady Gaga delivers a passionate version of "Till It Happens to You" with backup from other rape survivors. Bravo.
Amy wins Best Documentary and deserves it.
Thanks Louis CK for being funny and pointed in introducing Documentary Short Subject.
Night's biggest shocker. Mark Rylance beats Stallone for Best Supporting Actor. You could complain. Would it help? A gracious speech.
Chris Rock's visit to a Compton multiplex is so funny it hurts. No one's heard of any of the nominated movies.
Inside-Out deserves its Animated Oscar. But so did Anomalisa. Sorry.
Passed out for a minute and saw Chris Rock selling Girl Scout cookies and all the Oscar presenters turned animated.
Room  star Jacob Tremblay,9, looked excited to see the Star Wars robots on the Oscar stage. At least someone looked alive.Dull is sinking in
Nice moment seeing Margaret Sixel winning Best Editing for her husband George Miller's Mad Max.
Also supremely well deserved.
Three Oscars in a row for Lubezki. Chivo makes history with The Revenant.
"And the should have been nominated Michael B Jordan." Great intro from Chris Rock
Three technical Oscars in s row for the great Mad Max Fury Road and yet it has no chance for Best Picture and director George Miller. Stupid
Alicia Vikander wins Supporting Actress Oscar for Danish Girl and actually kisses boyfriend Michael Fassbender in public.
Spotlight and Big Short win Screenplay Oscars. Will they be the last awards these 2 great films win?

The Revenant grabs surprise win as Best Drama and might change the Oscar chances of Spotlight if the Globes meant a damn thing. They don't.
Leo DiCaprio wins Globe for Actor Drama and the audience applause should carry him home to Oscar. Very nice speech.
Brie Larson proves a popular choice as Best Actress for Room. No argument here.
Did I just seeTarantino chatting with Cate Blanchett whose movies he recently ridiculed? Well, I'll be.
2-time Globe winner Jim Carrey gives Comedy prize to The Martian, not a comedy at all. Big Short suffers a slight setback on road to Oscar.
Jennifer Lawrence was good in Joy, but Amy Schumer and Lily Tomlin deserved the Globe more. Sorry, haters:
Taraji P. Henson wins her Globe as the immortal Cookie Lyon in Empire. And hands out cookies. Good one.
Morgan Freeman gives Director Globe to Alejandro G. Inarritu  for The Revenant. George Miller and Ridley Scott, I personally salute you.
Tom Hanks gives great intro for Denzel Washington, the winner of DeMille award. Never seen Denzel that shaken.
Mr. Robot wins Best Drama Globe. Me? I couldn't be happier. The shoutout to Rami Malek so deserved.
Katy Perry gives Globe for Best Song to Sam Smith for Writing's On the Wall" from Spectre. A surprise given the song's meh reviews.
Lady Gaga wins acting Globe for American Horror Story. A genuine, heartfelt speech, but Queen Latifah got robbed for Bessie.
Son of Saul wins Foreign Film Globe, first ever prize for Hungary. And a great film by any measure.
Gael Garcia Bernal wins Globe for Mozart in the Jungle. Again, the Globes honor new work. Congrats.
Screenplay Globe goes, as it should, to Aaron Sorkin for Steve Jobs. A movie that I thought was forgotten.
Stallone gets his expected Globe for Creed and thanks everyone but the film's true talent, director Ryan Coogler. Wait, what!
Kurt Russell and step-daughter Kate Hudson give Inside-Out its deserved Globe for animation.
Matt Damon wins Best Actor Comedy for The Martian. Fill in your own joke.
Besties Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence present their own movies. I'm thinking Amy's remarks cut by the censors must have been funny.
Jon Hamm gets the Globe for last season of Mad Men. Ok, I guess. But Rami Malek  of Mr. Robot gets my vote.
Quentin Tarantino accepts composer award for the great Ennio Morricone for Hateful Eight.
ChristianSlater wins Globe for the terrific Mr. Robot. Alright!
Oscar Isaac wins Globe for Show Me a Hero. No mention of being in Star Wars.
Wolf Hall beats Fargo for the Globe. Bad call. Fargo is the Greatest!
Gervais intros Matt Damon as "the only person Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to." Good one.
Gotta hand it to the Globes for their TV https://t.co/YPggeMXisK stuff like Rachel Bloom and Mozart in the Jungle!
Maura Tierney also a surprise winner for The Affair. But how damn good she was this season.
Kate Winslet wins Golden Globe for Steve Jobs. She "extremely surprised," as are we all. Pleasantly.
Should win Golden Globes: Spotlight, Big Short, Schumer, Saoirse Ronan, Damon,Fassbender, Paul Dano, Vikander, George Miller. Which won't?

Affleck gives Best Director Oscar that he wasn't nominated for Argo to Inarritu for Birdman. The die is cast.
"Stay weird. Stay different" becomes the unofficial mantra of OSCAR  2015. Thanks Graham Moore.
Oprah gives Adapted Screenplay to Imitation Game. Graham Moore talks of wanting to kill himself at 16. His heartfelt speech honors the film.
Eddie Murphy gives Original Screenplay to Birdman. Smart money was on Budapest. But after Gaga, all bets are off. Is Wes clapping?
I'm sorry. The segment with Lady Gaga channeling a nun with ink sent me into feeling like I'm in the Twilight Zone. Was that Julie Andrews?
Nice comic touch that Travolta  and Idina Menzel present the Best Song OSCAR.

Meryl hands Best Drama to Boyhood. All is well with the world. But the show is way 2 respectable. For dull, we have the Oscars!
Actor Drama goes to Eddie Redmayne for Theory of Everything. Eddie is a charmer, who is an actor to his bones. Ditto the other 4 nominees.
McConaughey hands Actress Drama to a very excited Julianne Moore 4 Still Alice. A happy person has work and love. Congrats!
Robert Downey Jr. gives Comedy Globe to, surprise, Grand Budapest Hotel. Funny speech from Wes Anderson, but Birdman was robbed!
Comedy Actor win to Michael  Keaton in Birdman. He chokes up talking about his best friend, his son Sean. How do you not love this dude?
Actress TV Drama goes to Ruth Wilson in The Affair. Wish I could connect to that show. I can't.
Harrison Ford hands the directing Globe to Richard Linklater for Boyhood. I'm smiling.
Newlywed George Clooney, 53, gets early DeMille Life Achievement award. A humanist. A class act. When he says "Je Suis Charlie" he means it.
Actor TV Series Drama goes to Kevin Spacey 4 House of Cards. He must be very happy Breaking Bad ended its run. 1st win after 8 noms.
TV Series Drama goes The Affair when Good Wife, House of Cards, Game of Thrones and almost everything else far exceed it.
TV Actress goes to Maggie Gyllenhaal 4  Honorable Woman, leaving Frances McDormand award-less for being the very best in Olive Kitteridge!
Globe 4 Foreign Film goes to Leviathan, a Russian drama I just learned is pronounced la-bee-a-thin!
Where are the stoners &amp; drunks? The zglobes are getting as bland and self-serious as the Oscars. Where are the train wrecks?

Globe for Animated film goes to HowTo Train a Dragon 2, meaning Lego Movie didn't translate to the Hollywood Foreign Press?
Acerbic Ricky Gervais, bless him, gives Globe 4 Comedy to Amy Adams for Big Eyes leaving Emily Blunt to wonder how she went into the woods.
Globe for Supporting Actor goes so deservedly to Matt Bomer in Normal Heart, a TV movie as good as anything the big screen is turning out.
Prince, getting a standing O, gives song Globe to "Glory" from Selma. Good on Common &amp; John Legend. Their thank Us actually have meaning.
Globe for movie score goes to Theory of Everything when Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross showed how it's really done in Gone Girl.
Globe for TV Comedy Series goes to Transparent,a new series with guts that puts the Globes  ahead of the stodgy Emmys for cheering the new.
Globe for TV Comedy Actress goes to Gina Rodriquez for Jane the Virgin. Well deserved and first sincerely great speech of the night.
Selfie with fake North Korean journalist and Streep and Keaton falls flat. Where's Ellen when we need her?
TV Actor Globe goes to Billy Bob Thornton for Fargo, not McConaughey or Ruffalo. Not liking the way this is going.
Globe for TV Mini goes  to Fargo instead of Normal Heart or True Detective. Bad choice.
First Brit win of the night is Joanne Froggatt  for playing Lady Mary's maid in Downton Abbey. Nice one. But no one seems drunk yet. Damn!
Supporting Actor goes as it should to JK Simmons in Whiplash. Sometimes there really is no other way to go but to the best.

Lingering Oscar Question: why did 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen and screenwriter  John Ridley not thank or mention each other ?
To sum up: a slogging OSCAR show of no surprises but intensely satisfying victors. 12  Years a Slave now belongs to history. It was time.
Will Smith, RAZZIE winner, presents Best Picture to 12 Years. The first film about the black experience to win in the Academy's 86 years.
Jennifer "why are you laughing" Lawrence presents Best Actor to McConaughey. No surprise. But all right. All right All right! Great speech
Daniel Day Lewis Lincoln presents Actress to fellow Brit Cate Blanchett, who champions women and Australia with vigor and class.
Director Oscar fr Jolie &amp; a fragile Sidney Poitier to Alfonso Cuaron for Gravity. Mexico triumphs. And the wise guys at Warner bros.
Screenplay awards from a funny DeNiro:  Adapted to John Ridley for 12 Years. Original to Spike Jonze for Her. American Hustle loses again.
I'll have what Jamie Foxx is having, presenting  Musical Score to Gravity &amp; Best Song to,yes,Let It Go. Robert Lopez &amp; wife accept in rhyme.
Idina Menzel powerfully belts  "Let It Go" from Frozen into the presumed winner's circle.
Goldie Hawn gives us meaningless clips from the last  3 nominees for Best Picture. It's over. Unless more hero montages are coming.
Glenn Close intros In Memorium, from Gandolfini to Phil Hoffman. Bette Midler finishes with "Wind Beneath My Wings". Standing O for Miss M.
More hero clips, this time from Captain America Chris Evans. Make it stop!
Production Design goes to Great Gatsby. Has a lousy movie ever looked this beautiful?
Pink sings tribute to Wizard of Oz. Don't know why, what with Liza  &amp; Lorna in the audience. No complaints. Trumpet tonsils, that Pink.
Gravity also wins Best Editng. I smell a sweep.Cuaron is cut off by music . Nice one. All the time in the world for Ellen and pizza.
Amy Adams, looking like $146 million domestic re Bill Murray (nice shoutout to Harold Ramis, Bill), gives cinematography Oscar to Gravity!
Ellen's pizza gag is just wearing on me. Where are Amy and Tina when you so desperately need them.
Christoph Waltz gives Supporting Actress to  Lupita Nyongo. Yes. Yes. Yes. Gracious and lovely. And a name everyone should learn.
Charlize  &amp; Chris Hemsworth get all pompous about Sound Mixing. Gravity wins, deservedly.Sound Editing also goes to Gravity. Surprise dies.
Ellen takes selfie with the all the stars. Gag me.
Brad Pitt brings on U2 to do their worthy theme from the worthy Mandela. I miss Pharrell.
Tyler Perry, no dress,  brings on clips from 3 more Best Picture nominees, reducing real achievements to nothing . Bad idea, boringly done.
Foreign Film Oscar goes to The Great Beauty so everyone can remember when Fellini did it better.
More than an hour in, and the Oscars feel tired.
VP Frank Underwood intros awards to Hollywood vets Angela Lansbury &amp; Steve Martin,plus humanitarian Angelina Jolie whose speech is touching.
Bradley Cooper gives Doc Oscar to 20 Feet from Stardom. The Act of Killing snobs will turn up their nose. I'm smiling. Darlene Love u rock!
Lady in. No. 6 Doc short Oscar winner is wonderful, as is its star, who died a week ago at 110.
Whoops! Missed the whole Live Action short category. DAMN! What did everyone say?
Zac Efron brings on Karen O to sing Moon Song  from Her. Audience is now a million miles away.
Visual effects Oscar goes to Gravity. What a shock
Sally Field brings on more hero clips. I keep thinking I'm being sold something. Snippets demean some truly great movies.
McConaughey gives animated Oscar to Frozen. Mayazaki's last film The Wind Rises goes down to commerciality.
Great to see Kim Novak come out to the Vertigo theme. Old Hollywood glamour to the max
Young filmmakers intro'd by Channing Tatum. Audience dozes. And so begins that period where we wait for something, anything, to happen
Harrison Ford introduces 3 Best Picture nominees like a Prof announcing an unexpected quiz. Stuffy
Makeup Oscar goes to Dallas Buyers Club as it damn well should.
Costume Oscar goes to Great Gatsby, damn near the only award that dud deserved.
Pharrell  singing Happy proving that all best song nominees don 't have to be stupid and useless. Nice moves with Lupita !
Jim Carrey does Bruce Dern impression to Bruce Dern. Funny. Intros animated heroes.Not much.
Jared Leto wins Best Supporting Actor. Beautiful tribute to mom. Nicely done. Award much deserved. Good start .
First white presenter, Anne Hathaway. Good line from Ellen.
Smiles 2 Jared Leto 4 the shoutout in his Spirit Awards speech.Honored to be there with Baby Jesus, vegan butter &amp; his future ex-wife Lupita
Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel scored at Berlin Film Fest. Good. It's a gift package laced with sweet sadness  ,miles from nostalgia.

Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, 50 years old this week, lost the '64 Oscar to My Fair Lady. For a statue made of gold, Oscar has a damn soft head
Globes Wrap: McConaughey &amp; Cuaron into the Oscars with new heat. Streep &amp; Roberts need to play catchup. P Diddy &amp; Jackie Bisset need coffee.
Johnny Depp gives Best Drama Globe to, rightly, 12 Years a Slave. And so we go into the Oscars as a race between 12 Years &amp; American Hustle.
Jessica Chastain presents Best Actor to Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club. All right. All right. Go get it.
Leo presents Best Actress to Cate Blanchett who gets rightly pissed at the damned music that keeps playing people off .
Tina: Like a Supermodel's vagina let 's give a warm welcome to Leonardo DiCaprio.
Only Globe suspense left is whether the Globe for Best Drama goes to Gravity or 12 Years a Slave, which do far has been shockingly shut out.
Drew Barrymore presents American Hustle with the Best Comedy Globe. The win was expected. Now onto the Oscars.
Nice intro for Rush from Chris Hemsworth  and the real Nicki Lauda . But shouldn't nominee Daniel Bruhl who played Lauda have presented?
JLaw presents Leo DiCaprio Comedy Actor Globe and he accepts with humor and grace, especially the shoutout to the great Bruce Dern.
Brooklyn 99 wins Best Comedy. Guess the Globes got tired of Girls that fast
Tina Fey makes Michael Bay joke. Thank you, Tina !
Affleck presents Directing Globe to the brilliant Alfonso Cuaron for Gravity. Somehow herpes and earpiece have combined in the heavens !
Emma Stone intros Woody Allen tribute. Diane Keaton accepts &amp; sings charmingly. Woody stays home, typically. That's OK. His movies will live
Comedy Actress Globe and Bono shoulder rub goes to Amy Poehler. Good one !
Animation globe goes to Frozen. No surprise. But the score that made it got nothin.
Melissa McCarthy. &amp; Jimmy Fallon present Michael Douglas a Globe for his Liberace tour de force. More sequins!
Foreign Language film Globe to The Great Beauty suggests that 3 hours of hot lesbo action does not punch the ticket for the HFP.
Andy Samberg's comedy Globe is another nice surprise. Parsons can't win them all.
Emma Thompson gives Screenplay Globe to Spike Jonze for Her. A true shock in a Hustle / 12 Years year.
Waltz gives Supporting Globe to the right guy, Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club. Rock star Leto In a tux! Ok, then.
How many times can Kerry Washington keep losing awards? Unfair. But Robin Wright is a class act. So no complaints.
Jackie Bisset now becoming the joke of the night. Tina/Amy joke works!
Funny presenter speech from Robert Downey Jr. Amy Adams so deserved that Best Actress award. Meryl can 't win them all.
Jon Voight's Globe win for Ray Donovon puts a real smile on my face. Great performance
Great to see P Diddy present Globes with intoxicating exuberance that borders on the incoherence we expect from the Hollywood Foreign Press
Best Song Globe to Bono's Ordinary Love from Mandela that should have gone to "Let It Go " from Frozen.
All Is Lost wins Film Score award that belonged to Gravity.
Nice to see the real Philomena Lee onstage with actor and screenwriter Steve Coogan.
Breaking Bad ends and finally get respect from the Globes. It's too little and too late. Yeah, bitch!
Bryan Cranston finally wins a Golden Dildo for one of the best performance ever on TV. About time!
Wrong Cue cards for Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie. Who can't face an improvisation introfor their own Wolf of Wall Street. Yikes
What's with the "garbageman" insults these days? First, Steve McQueen gets heckled as one at the NY Film Critics . Now Matt Damon. A trend?
Lizzie Moss finally wins the prize  for Top of the Lake that she's deserved for Mad Men all these seasons.
Jacqueline Bisset near meltdown acceptance speech that won't quit. WTF!

Lame Seth McFarlane/Chenowith duet so makes me miss Neil Patrick Harris. And why no cameras in the audience? Here's to the losers, indeed!
Affleck speech from the heart. Though telling your wife that your marriage has been work? That's debatable.
Argo takes the Big One! Ben Affleck not getting nominated for directing wins him the race. Lincoln has been effectively marginalized. Wow!
Bringing  in the First Lady to intro the Best Film nominees? Is this a spoof of all the DC interference this year?
Did Streep open the envelope before? Either way Daniel Day Lewis  becomes 1st actor to win 3 Best Actor Oscars. Also, best, wittiest speech.
Jennifer Lawrence finds her silver lining. A breathless speech. But where's the mischief?
Jean Dujardin totally charming!
Why are Oscar cameras so bad this year at giving us faces in the audience? Wanted to see those directing nominees &amp; those not nominated.
Ang Lee wins directing Oscar for Life of Pi. Take that Spielberg! Loved his wife's expression when he said they'll be married 30 years.
QT takes the Oscar for Django. Even GWTW playoff music can't shut him up. You gotta love this guy.
Chris Terrio wins Oscar for Argo beating Tony Kushner's stellar screenplay for Lincoln. To which I say WTF
Adele crying real tears after winning for Skyfall. So far, I'm not feeling it.
How about you?
Sneaking in those  2 song nominees like an afterthought and then dragging out Norah Jones for a stage wait. Stay classy, Oscar.
Streisand sings Way We Were in honor of Marvin Hamlisch. Even hoarse and wavering, the voice has emotional heft.
George Clooney intros the memorials. Seeing my friend Lois Smith, publicist extraordinaire and human being supreme, heartbreaking.
Lincoln wins an award. It's production design but still.
Adele sings the hell out of Skyfall while the camera diverts focus with crazy montages. So stupid. Oscars now become the Grammys.
Argo wins first award of night for editing. Here we go!
Plummer gives the night's most predictable award to Hathaway. Speech is a disappointing laundry list of thank yous. Where's the drama?
A dramatic tie and it's for Sound! Zero Dark Thirty and Skyfall. Couldn't they have saved that for best picture?
Les Miz turns the Oscars into the Tony awards. Brave man that Russell Crowe!
Zeta lip syncs. Hudson sings live. Big diference.
Amour wins foreign language film. No surprise there. But will it win more?
Searching for Sugar Man wins best doc. WhooHoo!
Poor Liam Neeson having to intro a scene from Lincoln. Before DDL he had the role.
Shirley Bassey singing Goldfinger is truly indestructible. Deserved standing O. The Bond montage was meh.
We're the makeup and hair winners actually seated in the theater? They seemed so far away!
.
Costumes award perfectly deserved by Anna Karenina. And they didn't blow the winner off with Jaws. R they learning?
Rudest playoff ever for Life of Pi team. Jaws music? Really?
Life of Pi looking good going in!
All respect to Life of Li, but Will Roger Deakins never win an Oscar?
Waltz win in support instead of the unsmiling Tommy Lee Jones doesn't bode well for Lincoln.

True that! RT @meganeellison: Kathryn Bigelow was robbed. So fucked up. #recount
Who thinks the directing snubs for Bigelow and Affleck might help them win votes in the Best Picture race? Fingers crossed.
The only think dumber and more cowardly  Oscar can do is sign the Kardasians to host the show next year.
Did Best Picture nominee Django Unchained direct itself?
Did Best Picture nominee Argo direct itself?
Did Best Picture nominee Zero Dark Thirty direct itself?
Did the old boys club deny Bigelow an Oscar nod bec she won for Hurt Locker. R they done with the fem thing? Once every 100 years,that's it?
Oscar noms hit a new low in stupid: No Bigelow for directing? What?  No Affleck. No Tarantino. No Master. No Dark Knight Rises. Shameful!

Emmy snubs: John Slattery stellar on Mad Men ( LSD episode). Madeleine Stowe, a demon diva on Revenge,  Kelsey Grammer killing it on on Boss
2 Emmy sure things: Julianne Moore doing Sarah Palin to a turn in Game Change. And Claire Danes for kicking everyone's ass in Homeland.
If Emmy wants to make some big changes on Sunday, how about HBO's Girls as top comedy. Lena Dunham is the freshest new voice around.
Expectations are Mad Men won't win it's 5th Best Drama Emmy. My $$$ on Breaking Bad, which looks &amp; plays better than 90% of the movies I see

The moment has arrived. Here are my picks for the Summer #ScumBucket: http://t.co/Cr5aoLQP ‚Äì and here are yours: http://t.co/cFaufh4d
What was the best summer movie with a substitute star: The Amazing Spider-Man or The Bourne Legacy? http://t.co/3Z8XGT6O
The votes are split between Dark Knight Rises and Avengers - but was the best comedy Ted or the Dictator? http://t.co/3Z8XGT6O

What's the worst movie of Summer 2012? Battleship? Total Recall? Tell me your pick with #Scumbucket: http://t.co/n1Nre1E2
2 Days in New York is a bawdy comic bash, but the frenzied cross-cultural gags take the piss out of the real subject: http://t.co/oLb08ng3
#HopeSprings, with the incomparable Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, is full of hilarious and heartfelt pleasures: http://t.co/ktAvFRHo

Jean Dujardin's surprise SAG win last night as Best Actor for The Artist just put some much needed heat into a too predictable Oscar race.
RIP Damien Bona whose smart, irreverent 'Inside Oscar' books (written with the late Mason Wiley) are indispensable. So long, my friend.
Heads up: "Chronicle" opening on a Friday is teen movie you really  DON'T want to ignore. Who knew?
If "The Artist" wins the Screen Actors Guild award tonight for Ensemble, can any other film pull an upset and win the Best Picture Oscar?
"Arbitrage" is the best premiere film I saw at Sundance with an Oscar-worthy Richard Gere and director Nick Jarecki channeling Sidney Lumet
Benh Zeitlin's "Beasts of  the Southern Wild" wins jury prize at Sundance. Ben Lewin's "The Surrogate" wins the audience. Terrific choices.
At Sundance, Paul Simon tells me "Drive" is the film he admired most last year. I knew I liked that guy.

'The Grey' is a terrifically exciting, deeply unsettling survivalist epic that makes us face our own worst fears: http://t.co/PiNIhFIK
Oscar snubs Alberts Brooks/Drive. Ditto Fassbender for Shame, Shannon for Take Shelter & Swinton for Kevin. A new definition for ignorance.
Extremely Loud and incredibly trite gets a Best Picture nomination but Drive does not. Kill me now!
Oscar could have had 10 best picture nominations but went with 9, eliminating Bridesmaids. What's the message there?
Gary Oldman's best actor Oscar nod this am for Tinker  put a smile on my face I can't wipe off. So well deserved.
Acting doesn't get much better than the subtly brilliant display from Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin: http://t.co/M52EErvr

5th grade chorus from Bronx sings Over the Rainbow reminding 
us that sentiment is Oscar's guiding force. Maybe that's why we expect less.
The King's Speech wins Best Picture. Justice is not done. The Academy again mistakes Oscar night for Valentine's Day.
Best Picture at last. Spielberg makes losing seem preferable. Social Network can join Citizen Kane, Grapes of Wrath and Raging Bull.
Sandra Bullock hands the inevitable Colin Firth Oscar to Colin Firth. If only the former ' child sensation' gave in to his instinct to dance
Jeff Bridges presents Best Actress award to Natalie Portman. No surprise there. But Bening was robbed.
Coppola, Brownlaw and Wallach get their deserved standing ovation. Godard stays home and pouts.
Annette Bening presents Governor's awards. Is that the Academy's way of telling us Bening isn't winning?
Kathryn Bigelow hands Director award to Tom Hooper for King's Speech. My dreams go up in smoke.
Celine Dion sings a tribute to those who died in last year. And Halle Berry offers her own fitting tribute to Lena Horne.
Randy Newman gives truly funny speech. I still hate the Song category.
Song again. Florence does the 127 Hours. Paltrow does Country Strong dirge. Jennifer Hudson says it's Toy Story3. I say dump the category.
More forced banter between Franco & Hathaway. Mike Myers already made the Winter's Bone joke on SNL.
Best Editing goes to Social Network. Am I dreaming? Is the tide shifting to the real best picture of the year?
Hello Billy, to have you back where you belong! Nice nod to Bob Hope.Downey & Jude Law do Special Effects. Inception again, of course.
Oprah presents Best Doc. Coen brothers look to be napping. But winner is Inside Job. I wanted Banksy!
segment with Harry P, Toy Story 3, Social Network and Twilight as musicals falls flat.
Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal do Short films. Right, Jake, they kill you on Oscar pools. Winners Strangers No More & God of Love prove point.
Spacey sings! And intros Randy Newman Song from Toy Story 3. Then I See the Light fr  Tangled. Mandy Moore looking hot. What's doin there?
Cate also presents Costumes to Alice in Wonderland. Is The King's Speech losing momentum?
Marisa Tomei intros technical prizes. Cate Blanchet does Makeup. The Wolf Man wins. "Gross," says Cate. It's also a grossly bad movie.
Scarlet Jo and McConaughay present Sound mixing to Inception. And Sound Editing also to Chris Nolan's modern classic. Bravo!
2 Aussies Hugh Jackman & Nicole Kidman present Score to Reznor/Ross for Social Network. The  only correct choice.
Christian Bale wins.Bloody Hell. Well deserved. Great speech. "Where's my Quaker? Dickeklund.com"
Reese Witherspoon presents Best supporting actor. What, last year's best supporting actress Monique was busy? What happened to tradition?
Russell Brand  & Helen Mirren are actually funny. Denmark's In a Better World wins. I got that one right. So did the Academy.
Hathaway rips Hugh Jackman with song from Les Miz.  Franco as MM is scary. It almost works. Almost.
Late bloomer David Seidler gives first witty speech of the night. Stutterers have indeed been heard.
Original Screenplay goes to King's Speech. So the Social Network versus The King continues unabated.
Loved Sorkin's reference to Paddy Chayefsky and Network.
Javier Bardem & Josh Brolin, dressed as waiters, give Adapted Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin\ Social Network. Any other choice be absurd.
Who besides me is getting the vibe that this Oscar show is going to spring a few surprises?
Animated Feature goes, as expected, to Toy Story 3. And yes it would be cool to see Banksy.
Justin Timberlake is not Banksy. But who is? Animated short goes to 
Lost Thing. Is JT tweaking Kirk Douglas?
Melissa Leo gets bleeped! WTF?
Kirk Douglas presents Supporting Actress to Melissa Leo. I am very pleased!
Great to see Chris Nolan applauding his cinematographer. Nolan deserves more credit than Oscar chose to give him.
Inception wins Cinematography. No sweep for anything in sight.
Tom Hanks presents Art direction & Cinematography. Will it be a King's Speech sweep? Guess not. Alice in Wonderland wins Art Direction.
"James, you look appealing to a younger demographic as well." Good one, Hathaway.
Oscar starts by inserting hosts Franco & Hathaway into best picture nominees. Cute, but Billy Crystal did it funnier.
@questlove Well that makes my weekend. Thanks Q

My Tony wishes: Everyday Rapture's Sherie Rene Scott for actress musical. American Idiot's un-nominated John Gallagher, Jr for best actor.
Hollywood biggies up for Tony awards tonite‚ÄîDenzel, Zeta, Scarlett Jo, Walken, Jude Law‚Äîbut it's still the lousiest year in Broadway memory.
Kevin, ask Macchio about his Funny or Die video in which he tries to dirty up his image to get juicier roles.
On the Travers Take: At the Movies with Peter Travers - 'The A-Team,' 'The Karate Kid,' & Joan Rivers' doc. Watch now @ http://bit.ly/apwGEn
Right now, the Joan Rivers documentary, "A Piece of Work," is the funniest movie you can see anywhere. Hear it. Believe it. See it.
The return of HBO's True Blood Sunday puts Anna Sookie Paquin close to vamp sheriff Alexander Skarsgard. The sizzle meter goes way past 11
Both of today's 80's throwbacks, A-Team & Karate Kid, stumble. But I'll take the A-Team's  junky fun over the Kid's self-serious posturing.
@ChristianSBack Thanks for asking, Christian. The complete archive will be back soon.
On The Travers Take: Who Killed the Movie Box Office? http://bit.ly/bC9UPn
Scorsese's Shutter Island on DVD & Blu-Ray today. Grab it. This thriller demands and rewards a 2nd look. How do you interpret that ending?
Can Avatar make up for losing Oscar by winning MTV award tonite as Best Movie? Or will Twilight, Alice, Harry Potter or Hangover take it?
Idol winner Lee Dewyze sparked my Twitterverse by picking Shawshank as best prison movie. Lots of you think Cool Hand Luke. What say, Lee?
@bengriffith Ben, I'd have to put in a vote for another landmark Kubrick film on war: Paths of Glory.
HBO doc on the late John Cazale (Fredo in Godfather) is an unmissable lesson in acting. Touching commentary from Pacino, Buscemi & Streep.
Idol runnerup and single mom Crystal Bowersox says she doesn't see many movies but loved Once, Hi Fidelity and Romeo & Juliet (Leo version).
American Idol winner Lee Dewyze told me at lunch today that his favorite film is Shawshank Redemption. Is it the best prison movie ever?
@benmshields Amen to that, brother!
@HarlanCoben Agreed, my friend, but Torino made more bucks than any flick Clint acted in. How bout Eastwood as director of Caught? Good fit?
Clint Eastwood turns 80 today. Happy B-day Kid. Best acting? I say Unforgiven, In the Line of Fire & a nod to the underrated Tightrope. You?
Hopper is immortal in Easy Rider, Blue Velvet, Hoosiers & Apocalypse Now, but Out of the Blue is my pick for overlooked gem. What's yours?

@paulajordan07 Tony Vincent, John Gallagher & director Michael Mayer were robbed by Tony idiots. Weakest Broadway season in years!
Best box-office news is not the inevitable hit of dead Elm St. but the success of Please Give, a sharp comedy burning up the indie circuit.

If you're planning to see JLo in Backup Plan this weekend,  I say get a backup plan. Try the  Argentinian thriller The Secret in Their Eyes.
Al Pacino does his best acting since Angels in America in HBO's Dr. Kevorkian drama, You Don't Know Jack. Not an ounce of hoo-haw in it.

Campbell Scott, on TV in Damages and onscreen in Handsome Harry proves he's currently the most underrated actor making artistry look easy.
Who's been watching Treme on HBO? If not, get busy. This look at New Orleans post Katrina from The Wire's David Simon shames Hollywood crap.

Michael Bay retires from filmmaking! It's only April Fool, but I wish.
Release the Kraken on the cross promotion of Clash of the Titans on American Idol is a new low in hype. And Titans in fake 3D truly sucks!
@balbespi The Antichrist has been threatening for years to desecrate Rosemary's Baby. So far nothing. Doesn't Polanski have enuf problems!
Best new DVD you never heard of: Uli Edel's "Baader Meinhof Complex," a whipsmart thriller about a German terrorist group of the 1970s.
DVD Pick: An Education, a teen girl/older man romance. Carey Mulligan is so good Ms Bullock should return her Oscar to its rightful owner.
If you were one of those who shelled out a stiff $18 a ticket to see "How To Train Your Dragon" on IMAX 3D, did you think it was worth it?

Oscar rejects Hollywood's fattest hit and rewards low grosser Hurt Locker with it's top prize. Self loathing or something else? Discuss.
Tom Hanks presents one from the  10 Best picture nominees. it's Hurt Locker! Oscar went with quality not the box office. I'll be damned!
Streisand presents director prize to, yes, a woman! Bigelow makes history. The time has come indeed! No direct mention of her ex husband!
And Sean Penn hands the Oscar to Bullock. "Did I really earn this or just wear you all down?" Great speech.Touching as well.We needed it.
Actress also gets group: Whitaker on Bullock, Sheen flirty on Mirren,Sarsgaard on Mulligan,Oprah on Sidibe,Tucci on capping Streep's noms
And Kate Winslet hands the prize to Bridges. Deserving standing O to go with it! The Dude abides!
Best Actor gets the gangbang treatment. Pfeiffer on Bridges, Farmiga on Clooney, Moore on Firth, Robbins funny on Freeman, Firth on Renner.
The Argentine film beating A Prophet and White Ribbon for best foreign film officially marks this category as nuts.
Editing Oscar for Hurt Locker puts it ahead for Best Picture. This is always a key category. Why no shot of Cameron biting his nails?
Nice to see The Cove win the Oscar for doc. Maybe you'll rent it now. It's so worth your time and is packed with the emotion this show lacks
Is it just me or do Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin seem to be barely registering?
Clooney is enjoying an Oscar show inside his own head that I wish I could see.  Loved his  head bop after the Up in the Air clip.
Avatar wins for visual effects. Duh. Though Bradley Cooper announced it with real surprise.
Up wins for Best Score as it should. But that quick closeup of a blissed out Clooney was a real pick me up.
Isn't the endless dance number to the nominated film scores what this show promised to avoid? I can't find my own pulse. Release the Kraken!
James Taylor sings out the talents we lost this year with great tenderness. But this year's Oscarcast is running low on genuine emotion.
Bullock funny doing cinematography intro. And now Avatar trumps Hurt Locker and the contest is back on.
Nice of Morgan Freeman to explain the difference between sound editing and mixing. Hurt Locker takes down Avatar in both. Sensing a trend.
Twi icons KStew (cough) and Lautner intro tribute to scare flicks. And we needed this clip job why? Plus, scares out of context don't work.
Did you catch the shot of non Jim Cameron fan Kathy Bates when the winning art director called him a genius. Nice camera work.
Supporting Oscar goes to Mo'Nique of course. Her speech,  "It's about the performance not the politics," is righteous but a little cold.
Precious win for adapted screenplay the first shock of the night. It was Up in the Air's one shot at a win. Am I sensing more surprises?
Ben Stiller a vision in Avatar blue. The movie itself could have used some of Stiller's playful tail action. Jim Cameron laughed, politely.
Long intro to short film category. Know what? The 3 categories deserve the attention. But how did Matter of Loaf & Deaf ever lose?
John Hughes tribute fitting and moving. Great to see those actors on stage together. KStew & Lautner look like they never heard of him. Sad.
Downey & Tina Fey actually funny about screenwriting. Rolling Stone writer Mark Boal wins for Hurt Locker. One word: Whoo-hoo!
Why does Miley Cyrus looks so blowzy? She's just a baby. But Song category is for once done painlessly. Weary Kind the only logical choice.
Up wins for animation in a tough category. Yeah, Mr Fox is fantastic. But another good choice.
Waltz wins supporting as he should. "Oscar & Penelope that's an uber Bingo!" Well played and deserved!
All the Oscar talk about Gaby Sidibe maybe pulling a surprise Best Actress win  for Precious is making me hungry for an upset. You?
Bullock gave out free Dvds of All About Steve to all attendees at the Razzie ceremony. Talk about revenge! Hint: they make great frisbees
Kudos to S. Bullock for making good on her promise to show at the Razzies to get her prize as worst actress in All About Steve. Well played,
Transformers 2 takes the Razzie as the year's worst movie and Michael Bay gets worst director. Justice has been done. Razzie, I salute you!
It's Oscar morning so what are we feeling for Best Picture? The box office heat of Avatar or the heart of the underseen Hurt Locker?
I thank the Indie Spirit Awards for the Precious sweep. It was like the Oscars I see in my head though I know it will never happen.

Anyone think the cinematographer's prize to the black and white purity of White Ribbon is the start of a backlash against hi-tech Avatar?
A Prophet wins a bunch of Cesars (the French Oscar). Hear that Academy? You're so stupid about foreign films. Let the right one in this time
When I see a crap movie (Brooklyn's Finest) I now say "Release the Kraken" like Liam Neeson in the Clash of Titans trailer. It helps! Try it
Bridges, Bullock, Waltz & Mo'Nique are Oscar acting favorites. If an upset is possible who'd you like to see score? I'd pick Carey Mulligan
Prepare to be wowed by Mia Wasikowska in Alice in Wonderland. She also killed on HBO's In Treatment. Can't wait to see what she does next.
Congrats to Precious for cleaning up at NAACP with awards for film, director, script, actress & supporting actress. That movie has my heart.

Roman Polanski just named Berlin Film Fest's Best Director for his stellar work on "The Ghost Writer." Throw bouquets or stones accordingly.
Most idiotic charge leveled against Polanski's superb Ghost Writer? It's too "entertaining" to be a great film. Tell that to The Godfather.
Like Shutter Island or not, the charge of red herrings doesn't hold since each scene illuminates a troubled mind.Try keeping your eyes open.
I'm told I'm nuts to admire Shutter Island since it was hated by the NY Times, which liked the drooling Dear John. Scorsese vs Sparks? Hmm.

Sarah Silverman told me she picks Inglourious Basterds for Best Pic Oscar. She's down on Up & forgot Avatar after she saw it. Who agrees?

@Joan_Rivers Kudos on editing award for your killer funny doc and the interview you gave me at Sundance which remains my trip's highlight.
The drooling chick flick torture that is When in Rome took in a hefty $12 million this weekend. Those responsible should be deeply ashamed.
Forgive my heresy, but  Joe Don Baker was better in 1985's Edge of Darkness TV mini than the great Ray Winstone is in Mad Mel's film version
Come on Grammy, pick The Boss's song from The Wrestler, which the Academy even didn't nominate. For movie score, Michael Giacchino for Up.
Bigelow's Hurt Locker directing win shared in doc category by The Cove's Louie Pshihoyos. 2 great films making no $. Get cracking people!
Jon Hamm made a delicious fool of his Don Draper self last night 2nd time hosting SNL. Ditto on 30 Rock. Write him a real film comedy. Now!
What's with Sundance jury skipping acting prizes? Nothing for Gosling/Williams, Franco, Gordon-Levitt, Falco, newbie Jennifer Lawrence? WTF!
Sundance honors are schizo. Debra Granik's arty Winter's Bone takes jury prize. Audiences prefer TV touch of Josh Radnor's happythankyou...
Happy Sunday to glass-ceiling terminator Kathryn Bigelow. The DGA done good. The Oscar is hers but who thinks Avatar still wins best picture
If ex marrieds Kathryn Bigelow & Jim Cameron split the director vote tonite, who's your best spoiler? I'd go with the inglourious QT.
Sundance awards tonite: I'm rooting for Blue Valentine with Ryan Gosling & Michelle Williams and Catfish for doc. For twisted laughs, Cyrus
@AwardsDaily Time to end this boys' club, Sasha. And Bigelow is the perfect choice to do it.
I don't want Hollywood to film Catcher in the Rye, but what actor could play Holden Caulfield? I start the bidding with Paul Dano. Your turn
J.D. Salinger never let Hollywood clods touch his "Catcher in the Rye". Now that he's dead at 91 who joins me in hoping that they never do?

Sundance restaurant interview with 3 Backyards star Edie Falco interrupted by fire in kitchen so we took it to the snowy streets. Major fun.

2 days after lovely America Ferrara told me at Sundance this low-rated season of Ugly Betty was her proudest, ABC killed the show. Lesson?
Ryan Gosling & Michelle Williams deserve every acting award from Sundance juries. Their work in the devastating Blue Valentine is that good
@shawnlevy I tell you Shawn, Reggie's love for One on One was from the heart. His answer came wrapped in smiles. He cited Hoosiers as #2
@IcarusArts Sorry you didn't come over Joshua. Next tiime I hope. What's happening with your film?
@akruglov Good to meet you 2. And thanks for the kind words. Good for the heart. What did you like at Sundance?
@arps23 Send away Adam$
@AleHill It's a deal buddy. You are definitely not a member of the Society of F%!#s! Big Thanks for all your help!
@leakorsgaard @cinematical I ask actors to sing at the end of an interview bec it reveals a vulnerable side and breaks them out of the box.
John C. Reilly said I'd never get Ryan Gosling to sing on camera at Sundance. The intense Blue Valentine star warbled My Little Pony. Ha!
The more I think about Cyrus, the sharpest comedy at Sundance, the more I laff. Jonah Hill following mom Marisa Tomei into bathroom =classic
Joan Rivers doc at Sundance is mind-bendingly hilarious and surprisingly touching. Like the lady herself. One of best interviews I had here
@kristapley The Dude, man! He's time capsule stuff in The Big L.
Sundance food for the gods? The onion rings-they call it Onion Loaf-at The Bandit on Main Street. http://twitpic.com/zpfx6
Sundance loves the darkly funny Cyrus. But today I still aim to challenge stars Jonah Hill & John C. Riley to an on-camera snowball fight.
I begin my Subdance day talking with 3 Backyards star Edie Falco, robbed of a SAG award on Saturday for her stellar work on Nurse Jackie.
Ask anyone at Sundance what the hot film is and the answer keeps coming up Catfish, a doc about cyber romance that turns deeply dark.
Reggie Miller doc Winning Time is a Sundance treat. Asked RM what hoops film Hollywood got right? He said One on One with Robby Benson. Wha?
@arps23 Adam, it was such a kick meeting you and your dad. And big thanks for your good words.
About to do tv interviews at Sundance this AM with Joseph Gordon Levitt and James Franco. Any questions?
2 days into Sundance, the most beautiful & heartbreaking film is still Spike Jonze's half-hour short, I'M HERE. Can't get it out of my head.

@MrEuclid Guess the 2 of us are not on the same wavelength. First Up in the Air, now 500 Days. What have you liked, Will?
DVD Pick: Ricky Gervais' Invention of Lying, but only for the inspired 1st  third. The Globes host offers laughs you can't buy, officially.
Happy 64th B-day David Lynch. Blue Velvet, Mulhollad Dr, Twin Peaks, Wild At Heart &  Eraserhead are surreal candles that'll never burn out.
The Spider-Man prequel will be directed by Marc Webb of the excellent 500 Days of Summer. I was expecting a hack. Are we feeling hopeful?
Jersey Shore cast hitting Rolling Stone for lunch at 12:30PM. Any questions? The Situation will be ready to answer.
@erspamer_matt Well that just weirded me out!
@diablocody Do you think it helps that the movie practically removed the rape angle from Sebold's book? But you're right, Ronan is that good
On Dr. King's birthday I'm wondering what's up with the biopic Spielberg was planning. Who should star? Denzel, Jamie Foxx, an unkown?
Lovely Bones after a weak start is finding a big audience among teen girls. What's the attraction do you think?
AThought: Since the Golden Dildos proved they exist to award box office, can we change their avatar to a giant $ on a pedestal?
@Zachmandoo I will do it!
@jessbecauseiam Joseph Gordon Levitt deserved that award for sure.
@jorgemps Couldn't agree more. Felt very bad for Carey Mulligan, far more deserving than Bullock!
@BumbleWard It's the Globes, Sasha, and The Soloist didn't make any money.
Hurt Locker totally shut out of the Golden Globes. Congrats for being in classy company.
Avatar, that paragon on indie cinema, wins the big Globe. Nice to know there's an  awards group to help the little guy.
Jeff Bridges is the class act Globe winner of the night for Crazy Heart. Even the Hollywood Foreign Press can get it right. Occasionally.
Ricky Gervais looks so eager for the Globes to be over. So do we all.
Robert Downey jr wins for the appalling but huge box office hit Sherlock Holmes. Lovely how the Globes support the small movies.
Sandra Billock wins for Blind Side and will win the Oscar. Get used to it.
Hangover wins Golden Dildo for comedy. Guess 500 Days of Summer didn't make enough money. Priorites.
Glee wins best Tv show. I'm feeling it.
James Cameron's surprise win for Avatar-come on his ex wife was robbed-results in a gracious acceptance speech to new wife and former.
Scorsese points out the "shared dream" that defines movies past, present and future. He's one of the few still making dreams worth sharing.
De Niro sincere and hilarious in his tribute to Scorsese. DiCaprio justly  appreciative. A rare tribute that actually feels heartfelt.
Jane Lynch does NOT win the Golden Globe for Glee. I officially think the Hollywood Foreign Press are idiots.
Finally Drew Barrymore wins for Grey Gardens. Costar Jessica Lange got the Emmy DB deserved. Her best performance ever!
Any reason T Bone Streep doesn't mention Amy Adams by name in her acceptance speeches. After all She is Julie to her Julia.
Really liked Grey Gardens but the laundry list of names read by the winning producers is why people hate award shows.
Globe wins for Julianna Maguiles and Michael C. Hall. Finally some sense.
Gervais says, "A Golden Globe cannot be bought, officially." I love it.
Beatle Paul's line about animation a good one. "it's also for adults who take drugs."
Globe show same old stuff, but the scary shot of William Hurt in that beard woke me up.
@gurghi Point taken.
Golden Globe Stupidity #4: nominating Tobey Maguire for overacting in Brothers & ignoring Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner & Moon's Sam Rockwell.
Golden Globe Stupidity #3: Last Station lead Christopher Plummer gets a supporting nod at the expense of In the Loop's superb Peter Capaldi
Golden Globe Stupidity #2: Julia Roberts nominated for the misfired Duplicity is a damned insult to Zooey Deschanel in 500 Days of Summer.
Golden Globe Stupidity# 1: Nominating It's Complicated for screenplay over Serious Man, An Education,Precious,500 Days of Summer & Messenger
Sandra Bullock's near certain Globe win tonite shouldn't blindside anyone. Her role makes Sarah Palin voters all warm inside.
Globes are better with TV than fartbag Emmys. Newbies Glee, Nurse Jackie Falco, Good Wife Margulies & the great Jane Lynch could even win.
If Hurt Locker beats Avatar for the Golden Globe tonite, the little movie that could will be sitting pretty in the Oscar race.
@AwardsDaily I understand the theory, Sasha. But it still bothers me.Carey and An Education deserve way more love.
@mattwarren well said, my friend. It's why award shows are becoming increasingly irrelevant.
Hurt Locker wins the big prize. Avatar gets action award. Hangover  comedy. Basterds & Up in the Air for writing. All bases covered. Blah.
And may I add that Carey Mulligan was robbed.
The Streep-Bullock actress tie is a copout. But Bullock's funny, touching acceptance speech just made her the Oscar favorite IMHO.
Loved best actor winner Jeff Bridges for thanking the critics for rewarding him after years of press junket roundtables. Tit for tat, Dude.
Critics award to Kathryn Bigelow as Best Director is so satisfying bec it is so deserved. Nice to see her ex Jim Cameron leading the cheers
Why would the  broadcast critics  dilute the meaning of awards by jamming in so many categories (action, comedy,etc) that they lose meaning?
Critics Choice awards must put Kristin Chenowith out of her misery. Such awful writing and strained humor.
Here's hoping the Broadcast critics won't go all Golden Globes box office ass kissing on their VH1 awards tonight. Avatar isn't everything.
Times Sq billboard of Mel Gibson's new movie. Seeing next week. What vibe are you getting? http://twitpic.com/y8iko

Kill Me Now! Taylor Lautner will sit at the Hurt Locker table at Sunday's Golden Globes. Why? Says GG's prez, "to make the table glamorous."
Congrats to Conan for showing something I don't see a lot in pop culture today: backbone.
@MrEuclid I do. Up in the Air is a serious comedy that gets at something Americans don't even know we've lost: our sense of shame.
@MrEuclid Will, what happened to staying positive?
Tobey Maguire dumped from go-young Spider-man prequel. It's art not commerce, studio says. No word yet if Peter Parker will be a vampire.
Screw Writer's Guild noms since they dropped films from scribes who aren't members:  No Basterds, D9, Up, In the Loop, An Education. WTF?
Re Hurt Locker DVD: Go Blu-ray. See why Jeremy Renner deserves the acting nod the dumb Golden Globes gave to ex-Spider-man Tobey Maguire.
DVD Must: Bigelow's Hurt Locker. A paltry $13 million box office means you need to catch up and see what Oscar will soon be shouting about.
I leave you tonite with thoughts of critic turned filmmaker Eric Rohmer, dead at 89. He put the art in cinematic conversation. Bless him.
@AwardsDaily Tennessee Williams would spin in his grave if Madonna played Blanche. I'd vote for Kate Winslet as the new movie Blanche.
@AwardsDaily Funny how the very British Leigh won her 2 deserved Oscars for playing Southern belles in Streetcar and Gone with the Wind.
@chameleoncloud Fassbender was also at tonite's NY critics party to celebrate Hunger. Did you see him in Fish Tank? He's got a big future.
@AwardsDaily If they remade Streetcar who'd you cast as Blanche? Just saw the great Cate do her on  stage. But the movies need ... what?
@chameleoncloud We had a fun chat. I joked about him going Hollywood doing Green Hornet. Waltz said he hasn't met any sleazebags yet. Wait.
Clooney introduced me to his new girlfriend Elisabetta tonite. An Italian beauty with charm to rival George's.
Kathryn qBigelow looks good with a directing award in her hand. The first of many I think and richly deserved. Listen up, Oscar.
Standing O for great film critic Andrew Sarris, 81, a moving tribute from NY Critics. Ditto words from former student Kathryn Bigelow.
George Clooney is the wicked life of the NY Film Critics party tonite at Crimson. Jabs Rex Reed for reviews that always say, "Clooney sucks"
@hy_steria Julia, thank god!
NY Film Critics party tonite: an informal chance to see Clooney, Streep, Waltz & Bigelow in same room before they become award-show staples.

@opica I'm with you on that one.
@yvetteava I thought yes, and he did it. Happy news.
@sexbiscuit Dafoe says the Green Goblin would kick the ass of his vampire slayer in Daybreakers. Love the question.
For  those who thought I was wrong to predict the DGA  would nominate Lee Daniels over Eastwood (Invictus), I say don't rule out Precious.
Directors Guild got it right with Bigelow (Hurt Locker), Cameron (Avatar), Reitman (Up in the Air), Daniels (Precious) & QT (Basterds).
http://twitpic.com/x22c5 - From the way Willem Dafoe holds a guitar in my Rolling Stone office, can he play it or not?
Willem Dafoe's role in Shadow of the Vampire makes him the only actor to be Oscar nominated for playing a vamp. Who else would you pick?
People's Choice awards: New Moon best movie, Taylor Lautner & Miley Cyrus breakout actors. So the people are all 13-year-old girls, right?
Willem Dafoe Trivia Question: he starred in 2 films that won the Best Picture Oscar. Can you name both off the top of your head?
@AwardsDaily DGA picks: Bigelow, Cameron, Reitman, Daniels, Tarantino.
Willem Dafoe, vampire slayer in Daybreakers, in my Rolling Stone office this am for Off the Cuff interview. Good starter questions anyone?
@donrlewis22 hey, I'm doing my best.
1 of the best '09 movies you never heard of hits DVD today,Robert Siegel's Big Fan with a terrific Patton Oswalt as a NY Giants obsessive
Happy Producers' nodded to small stuff (Precious, Hurt Locker, An Education, Up in the Air). But why shaft Messenger, 500 Days & the Coens?
Producers Guild noms for Best Movie this AM inc 3 sci-fi (Avatar, District 9, Star Trek). If that's a hint of what Oscar will do OK by me.
@smokebluntz Gotta agree.
@camsontheradio I do like Schneider. But Woody Harrelson is the only 09 supporting actor that deserves to be up there with Waltz.

@JasonReitman Congrats on the fresh kill. What's on the movie bill at Chez Reitman this first weekend of 2010?
@ropeofsilicon Done!
1. Up: A funny, touching and vital portrait of a marriage in four minutes of Pixar magic. Genius is an overused word. Not here.
2. Precious: The scene with social worker Mariah Carey when mother (Mo'Nique) and abused child (Gaby Sidibe) finally understand each other.
3. Up in the Air: The hard realization, reflected on George Clooney's face, when he learns that traveling light may not be the answer.
4. The Hurt Locker: Soldier Jeremy Renner afraid and lost, not in the act of defusing a bomb in Iraq, but alone at home in a supermarket.
Where the Wild Things Are: "I want to eat you up, I love you so." A moment that captures the terror and beauty of childhood.
6. Inglourious Basterds: Tarantino topping himself at shattering our nerves in the opening scene with the Nazi and the French farmer.
7. Crazy Heart: Jeff Bridges taking on Bear, the sound man out to ambush his stage act. It's the outline of a life in one telling moment.
8. A Serious Man: The phone call in the final scene that might be the biggest cosmic joke that the brothers Coen have ever pulled.
9. 500 Days of Summer: Joseph Gordon Levitt's dance thru the streets to the bounciest Hall & Oates the morning after he & Summer make love.
10. Avatar: the moment of true emotional dimension when Jake Sully and his blue avatar lie side by side in a blending of mind and heart.
Happy 2010 Twitterverse pals. As promised, I'll start out the new year by remembering my top 10 movie moments from 2009. Love to hear yours.
http://twitpic.com/w3bc1 - Best 09 use of movie poster. Name the movie & the poster?
http://twitpic.com/w28v8 - Nightclub scene with best actress of 09. Can you name?
Best putdown comes in Star Trek when Zachary Quinto's young Spock speaks the words, "Live long and prosper," as a massive fu to Vulcan sbobs
Best hetero screen chemistry of 09: George Clooney & Vera Farmiga turning themselves on by comparing elite status symbols in Up in the Air.
No one's seeing the musical Nine, so you're missing a Penelope Cruz strip that singes the screen. That'll teach you to listen to critics.
Sacha Baron Cohen's Br√ºno used a "God Hates Fags" protest march and a  specialist in scaring gays straight to bite hypocrisy's ass. Bravo.
Wow shootout? Clive Owen blowing holes in NYC's Guggenheim Museum in a bullet ballet that made a decent film, The International,  dazzling.
Notorious was unloved, but newbie Jamal Woolard got Biggie's flow down rapping the "uh" in the "it's all good, baby, bay-bee, uh" on Juicy.
An indelibe face? Marion Cotillard in Public Enemies being told in jail that her lover's dying words were, "Tell Billie, bye bye blackbird"
Indelibe verbal moment from the films of '09: In the Loop's Peter Capaldi turning swearing into an art form. "Lubricated horse cock," indeed
#10yearsago I overrated American Beauty when Fight Club, Magnolia, Election, The Limey & Being John Malkovich better stood the test of time.
@DANNY_DICKBLOOD Glad to help you fill the void, Danny boy.
Even the brutal reviews of Lovely Bones can't deny the terrible beauty of young Saoirse Ronan when her spirit flees her body's rape & murder
Hard to forget Michael Moore in Capitalism: A Love Story putting up crime scene tape around Wall Street. Talk about laugh till it hurts!
Funniest 09 movie cameo?  That guy from Tootsie (don't want to spoil the surprise for DVD watchers) who adds comic dynamite to Zombieland.
Indelible 09 movie moment from This Is It. When Michael Jackson busts his 1st move on "Wanna Be Startin Something." Pop poetry in motion.
@msnyder01 No worrez. Wait for New Year's day when I countdown the Top 10 indelible movie moments.
@mrRuimy Well, IG is #11 on my list. It was the silly Brad Pitt stuff that hurt it a little. The rest is aces.
@truthaboutmusic Maybe. But no 2 films were more cynically conceived and made with more contempt for their audience. That = time capsule bad
Indelible 09 Film Moment: a blissfully juiced Nic Cage winking at an iguana no one else can see in Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.

@AwardsDaily I'd love to hear your reaction to a 2nd Avatar visit.
@TheFunnyJosh You're serious about your Avatar grudge, Josh? Let me just say that what Cameron achieves amply compensates for his screwups.
@bpdreview I like your enthusiasm, Brian. Police Adjective is a real Love/Hate thing. My favorite kind of film.
@ReelTalker Not so with Snatch, Candice. One of Brad Pitt's best.
Taking a 2nd look at these Foreign Film screeners. Which intrigue you, which don't? http://twitpic.com/vgvax
Now that most of you have seen Sherlock, do you agree or not that Downey's fine acting is buried in the junkyard of Guy Ritchie's directing?
@imscottmurphy Amen to that, Scott. Could a movie get a better compliment from a modern audience?
@akstanwyck Good one. Have you seen Avatar in 2D to make a comparison?
Btw: My top 3D moment in Avatar is Jake Sully's taming of the banshee and their takoff into splendiforous flight. What's yours?
Why is Avatar 3D a hit? Shot this last nite. Audience actually stopped stuffing its  face during the banshee scene. http://twitpic.com/vcc0n
@iamBenLyons Absolutely!
Best one line review of 09 is the indefatigable Roger Ebert @ebertchicago citing Up in the Air as "Death of a Salesman starring Cary Grant"
Robin Wood died 12/18. Read him on Marnie in Hitchcock's Films, resee the film&learn what great film criticism is. http://twitpic.com/vbisl

@EDouglasWW The thing is Ed, I don't see blue people generating the same repeat biz as Leo and Kate- in any decade.
Snow blamed for Avatar failure to break box office records debut weekend. With Cameron it's always slow and steady wins the race. Just wait.
Jeff Bridges tried to teach me guitar on my Popcorn show. His only known failure. http://twitpic.com/ue472
Glad to rewatch all 4 Academy screeners (Precious, Crazy Heart, Nine, Orson Welles) but gave Jeff Bridges first dib. Truly great acting.
Snowed with these Oscar screeners. Which would you watch 1st? Never? http://twitpic.com/uckwl
@jillinsk Avatar is the one 3D film I've seen that feels organic and not self conscious. Go for it, Jill. Let me know how you feel.
@Bandini1 Not terrible. Just a bit like going to the opera with ear plugs.
@benmshields Like your shoutout to Sigourney! She gives Avatar as classy, witty human touch.
@AlanMattli My point exactly!

@McHenryFilmBuff Couldn't disagree more!
SAG Smarts: Appreciation  for An Education as one of the year's best. The Golden dickwads couldn't find room for it. Not enuf big names!
SAG Stupidity:  No nod to Glee's Jane Lynch. WTF? You guys are supposed to be actors. You're supposed to know comic brilliance. Shame!
SAG Puzzler: Diane Kruger gets the acting nod for Inglourious Basterds instead of Melanie Laurent who gave the film its bruised heart? What?
SAG again: Not to beat a dead horse. But Bullock's actress nod for Blind Side is just another step toward her Oscar. Laff now, cry later!
SAG Shocker: The best cast award that usually translates into best movie ignored Up in the Air. And for what? The hit-and-miss Nine! Sheesh
SAG nominees included solid choice of Jeremy Renner in Hurt Locker. The Golden Dildoes suck up to big names to get ratings for their TV show
@bdkreviews Gladiator, Chicago, Driving Miss D,  other best film victors did not win Oscars for their directors. Way to spread gold around.
@bdkreviews My guess is Up in the Air for Picture. Bigelow for director.
@TSpagnola When haven't the Golden Globes left a bad taste?
@ryanlavia Bullock is the Sarah Palin of this year's Oscars. Her enemies make her supporters more determined. You can't buy that kinda heat.
@ReelTalker No one's counting on it, which makes it kind of irresistible.
@AlanMoote And that's bad why?  Many great films keep the dream open and let us dream the rest. Lynch is a poet of cinema like Almodovar.
@bdkreviews Amen to that brother! Mulligan deserves it. But I'm talking Oscars and Bullock, the populist choice, is good for business!
@JasonReitman  Bacon before steak-  a high for the arteries! As DDL sings in Nine,"What's a good thing for if not for taking it to excess"?
Just talked to Hugh Grant about the comedy actors he admires. He used the word "genius" for Sandler, Rogen, Rudd & especially Michael Cera.
Some folks are shocked Sandra Bullock got a Globe nod for Blind Side. Wake up! If there's a surpise win at the Oscars it'll be Bullock.
One thing the Globes get right is TV with nods to fresh shows like Modern  Family and Glee with the must-win Jane Lynch. Listen up, Emmy!
What do the Golden Globes have against Zooey Deschanel? They nod to the movie and Joe G-L but skip her for Julia Roberts in Duplicity. WTF!
@JasonReitman Verdict, please.
@KarinaLongworth Fair enuf, Karina. It's a sharp funny movie. But the dialogue is mostly improv.
@akstanwyck That's exactly what I'm feeling.
Another close NY Critics vote was Clooney over Jeff Bridges. I think they'll go neck and neck down the Oscar wire. What horse r u backing?
NY Film Critics voting ended in a squeaker win for In the Loop as best screenplay over Up in the Air. Up haa the strionger structure, no?
@JasonReitman Ouch. But at least Boston is showing great taste in movies.
Congrats to LA film critics for naming Jeff Bridges best actor for Crazy Heart. The Dude abides.
Prepping for NY Film Critics voting Monday AM. LA crix picked Hurt Locker. What movie will get the most love from us Big Apple types?
@JasonReitman Good one. What's the better airport, Logan or LAX?

Since Mo'Nique won't campaign for a 'Precious' Oscar should the Academy ignore her? Hollywood Elsewhere's Jeff Wells says YES. You?
@alexrtravers You are breaking my heart!
@SheilsBabe Go for it!
Inteviewing Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin this noon for my ABC Popcorn show re "It's Complicated" and hosting Oscars. Any silly questions?
Holiday Hell: Blind Side rises to No. 1 while Fantastic Mr. Fox sinks to box office indifference. Do something.

Big laff: Asked Lovely Bones star Saorise Ronan her favorite team. She said Edward. Her director Pete Jackson thought we were talking soccer
@JeromeJMJ I think so 2. PTA seems to the filmmaking pioneer of the new century.
@CTCMR Always. Isn't that the fun of movie reviewing?
@DANNY_DICKBLOOD Lovely. Reading you, Danny, is like the rebirth of Noel Coward.
@thekingbulletin Both I think. A 4 star review means a "classic." How many of then have you seen in 2009?
@jackrapoport The true definition of Hollywood madness!

Congrats to Jason Reitman for winning Best Picture love from the National Board of Review this PM.
@JasonReitman Wonder how your dad would have done it differently.
Ba-zing!! Paul Thomas Anderson's next will star Phil Hoffman and take on God. PTA topped the decade with There Will Be Blood. Who's stoked?
Does country music's Ryan Bingham‚Äîhe sings 'The Weary Kind' in Jeff Bridges' Crazy Heart‚Äîknow George Clooney has his name in Up in the Air?

@AwardsDaily Well?
Best casting news? Chrs Walken will return to Broadway next year. The Man live on stage. Now that's exciting!
Points to the Gotham awards for naming Hurt Locker best film. But points removed for not even nominating Precious in the same category. WTF?
@CurtisWebster not till next week, dammit!
@DANNY_DICKBLOOD Nicely put, Danny.
@FogartyJones Sad to say, you better get ready. Bullock is fast becoming the Oscar favorite of Sarah  Palin supporters.

@themattmalone Nope. Saw Brothers a while ago. This one is splashed with laffs and adventure. I know you can figure it out, Matt.
@JasonReitman Whew!
Just saw the next to last 2009 film I need to do a 10 Best list. Despite 2 fireball actors, it's not making it. One  more to go: Avatar.
@BumbleWard Keep on keeping on with the "Education" love, Bumble. It needs it.
@JasonReitman You never saw The Apartment? Really? Really!!!!
@EDouglasWW Me 2 but history differs.  Think snubs to Giamatti (Sideways), Sally Hawkins, Scott-Thomas, etc. Bullock has the glam factor.
@paulajordan07 Would love Depp and Stuhlbarg to happen but think other 3 spots will go to Day Lewis, Colin Firth and Mandela Freeman.
@EDouglasWW What exactly does the industry have against Bullock? Isn't she good for business? Isn't that a top priority?
@paulajordan07 I think the Best Actor race with be a photo finish between George Clooney (Up in the  Air) and Jeff Bridges (Crazy Heart)
@AwardsDaily What about Alec Baldwin? Does It's Complicated make him a lock for Best Supporting Actor?
Looking forward to seeing James Spader make his Bdwy debut in David Mamet's "Race." Let's hear arguments on what is Spader's best film perf.
@hy_steria Mirren for bring brilliant, sexy and rowdy as Tolstoy's wife in the upcoming "Last Station." Dame Helen is in peak form here.
@mensanthemovies I have total love for Cornish in.Bright Star. She dwarves the Oscar nomination Bullock wil probably get for Blind Side.
@harlancoben Everyone's a critic!
@hitRECordJoe Amen to that brother
@AwardsDaily Sasha, what-no love for Carey Mulligan? And now that you've seen It's Complicated, is it Streep for that or Julie & Julia?
@chipinny No way is she better than the other 4.  I'm sayin the movie is striking a chord and Bullock will be its Oscar  standard bearer.
Now that Nic Cage's Bad Lieutenant is slumping, this photo suggests Cage may regret taking on Keitel's role.  http://twitpic.com/rd5sl
As "Blind Side" continues to cash in, look for Sandra Bullock to join Streep, Sidibe, Mulligan and Mirren in the Best Actress Oscar race.
Is "Blind Side" killing at the box office because America wants to see a  Republican woman kicking ass? I'll take Bullock over Palin anyday
Fab lunch: leftover Thanksgiving turkey with stuffing smeared with cranberry on toasted sourdough! Should I add avocado or it go at that?
Took a 2nd look at "An Education" last nite at a packed Cape Cod movie house. Liked it even more. Carey Mulligan should be Oscar's darling.
Who thinks "Lives of Others" deserves inclusion among the decade's 10 Best?
Stormy Cape Cod morn this Thanksgiving weekend. Shake me up to finish list of decade's best movies. http://twitpic.com/ravye
To keep your movie Thanksgiving happy avoid the witless persistence of Old Dogs. Or maybe you have your own contender for prize turkey?
Also caught Curb Your Enthusiasm finale from Sunday. The last scene with Larry and Cheryl had just the right blend of romance and neurosis.
Got 3 more 2009 movies to see before I can do my 10 Best list.I have a feeling the best isn't yet to come.
Just caught Joseph Gordon Levitt's SNL stint from Sat. His Make Em Laff opener from Singin in the Rain was killer. Write this guy a musical

Just saw Jeff Bridges give a performance as a broken country star in Crazy Heart that should have Oscar heat.  Is the Dude the best or what?
@At today's interview Crispin Glover expressed special fondness for River's Edge. I totally agree.
@walkingtaco I think I know but I'll ask him anyway.
Crispin Glover at RS this PM for Off the Cuff talk. What's on your mind about Crispy? And what role of his can't you get out of your head ?
Here's Viggo with pin. http://twitpic.com/pv4nr
Viggo says The Road means as much to him as any he's made. But he wore a pin from a film he did this decade that I love. Can you guess?
@Bottlerocket Good question. More Strider I think.
Viggo says his son Henry is a film scholar. Want Henry for a duel review of The Road on my podcast. He sees Road 2nite.  Hope Henry says yes
Viggo really kicked in interview. He's still pissed that Cronenberg has never even been nominated for an Oscar. Me 2.

Quick review of 2012: IMHO‚ÄîPOS
Woody Harrelson's RS visit was killer. When I asked which of his films he'd like to bury, he chose Money Train & The Walker.  Arguments?
Had breakfast today with "Hurt Locker" screenwriter Mark Boal. We talked great war movies. His pick. "Battle of Algiers." What's yours?
@thekingbulletin The Precious backlash is just absurd and yes it will do very well at the Oscars. Great movies always stir things up.
@taylorrae Streep's only 2 Oscar wins were for those movies. Isn't it about time for a 3rd? Maybe Julia Child will cook one up for her.
@BeBesaysmwah xx back atcha for even remembering She Devil ever existed. And where is Rosanne these days?
@Rbrentl88 Close but no cigar, I'm afraid.
@ScottFeinberg Thanks for the shoutout, Scott. And congrats on a piece that's indispensable for the Twitterverse.
Streep laughed when I noted her 1st screen kiss with Clooney was done with fox puppets: "it's probably the only way it's gonna happen." Ah.
Backstage Wes Anderson told Meryl Streep he particularly admired her performance in Postcards from the Edge. What's your favorite Streep?
Just bk fr Apple store in Soho. Moderated a lively Fantastic Mr Fox q&a with Wes Anderson, Meryl Streep &Jason Schwartzman. All in top form.
Stephen King's 1000 page "Under the Dome" just out.  Got me thinking of my fave King on page (The Shining) and film (Carrie). Your thoughts?
Props to Jason Reitman (Up in the Air) & Duncan Jones (Moon) for vigorously promoting their films around the globe and with smarts and flair
@jbstrevel I have indeed J.B. and I'm sticking with "Mad Men" as the best. Good stuff happening though on "Burn This."
Don't buy the negative "Avatar" buzz. Cameron knows 3D & IMAX can save the movies. If he half pulls it off, box office & Oscar will respond.

@JasonReitman OK, I'll bite. Why so strange?
@frankenteen And when you're back in the Big Apple, give a call and we'll do the RS cover wall.
Good News: Precious, reportedly 2 grim to score big bucks, opened to $1.8 million in 18 locations for a record-breaking $100,000 per screen
Spending today watching advance DVDs to pick top wowsers for  next issue of RS. So far Star Trek kills it for looks & sound + great extras.
Took my own advice and saw "This Is It" a 2nd time. Kid with his dad got up and danced during Beat It. That's what I call a true MJ tribute.
Thanks to all who linked me to Streisand singing "Gentle Rain" but I want to find the 1966 movie of same name that the song came from.
@rollingstone90 Thanks for the heads up on this one. Loved it.
Woke up to radio playing Streisand's melting take on "Gentle Rain," a bossa nova from a 1960's movie I can't find anywhere. Can you help?
"New Moon: The Twilight Sag"a opens in 2 weeks. Who's pumped? And who's content to stay home with "Vampire Diaries" and "True Blood" on DVD?
Note to non-fans of Michael Jackson: Don't pass up "This Is It". Seeing him on stage and vulnerable may just open your eyes to his artistry
The performance-capture Xmas Carol hollows me out with tricked-up 3D and dead-eyes. Would've loved seeing Jim Carrey play Scrooge for real.

Ricky Gervais to host Golden Dildos, er Globes, on Jan. 17. Wise decision, since this cutting-edge Brit is congenitally unable to kiss ass.

@RaquelCepeda I think only Waltz will be nominated, Raquel. Pitt's performance didn't get universal love.
@anotherMJ Sure it can, Matt. What galls me is that "Adam" wants credit for going deeper without actually doing it.
@slevvers Those count too, Bradley.
@theworldofdeuce It's that Copley is Oscar caliber but won't get nominated that makes the process so D-mented.
@RaquelCepeda He probably does, Raquel, which is why the Oscar system is so broken.
@theworldofdeuce Your point being?I did see IB and don't see who's being underrated. No way is it certain Oscar nominee Christoph Waltz.
Most overrated actor this summer is Hugh Dancy in Adam. Putting a pretty face on Asperger's does not advance understanding of that syndrome.
Don't get me started: Most underrated actor this summer is Sharlto Copley in District 9. People should be doing handstands over this guy.

D9 is No1 at box office with $37 million. GI Joe falls 60%. There is some justice.
@harlancoben Ok I'll bite. What's Numero UNO on your top 5?
@harlancoben Very nice. Asked Mary Clark to pick her fave Hitchcock film in honor of the master's 110 b'day. What's yours, mystery man?
@Kajll Seeing Vertigo made me want to write about film-my personal Hitchcock pick. As for D9, see it now! It kills the bad taste of Trans2.
@twinlorna Paradine Case never gets any love. Hitchcock wanted Robert Newton for the Louis Jordan part. But PC is tasty. Thanks for reminder

Guys: If you agree to see the sappy Time Traveler's Wife with a date, it must be love. Why else dive into this tank of molten marshmallow?
@tguard imho Harry Potter is fantasy not sci-fi so it doesn't fit the category.

Feud time: Watch Entourage Sunday and see Seth Rogen gets dissed. Kevin Connolly says the attack was provoked by something snide Rogen said.
@ghetto_journo My guess is that Emmy slugs will wake up to True Blood next year. They are always skittish about new shows,except Mad Men.
Emmy Stupidity #3: With all the love for Mad Men, nothing for January Jones who got so deep into the neglected wife they breathed together.
Emmy Stupidity #2: Heroes isn't what it was first season. But  Zachary Quinto (Star Trek) just nails his villain role and deserved a nod.
Emmy Stupidity #1: No nomination for Anna Paquin who just lights up HBO's smart and sexy True Blood (also ignored in the series category)
@Magialuna Clare, nice job getting on the Tom Felton bandwagon. He and Alan Rickman put talent and tortured soul into the new Harry Potter.
@joshuavalin Whatevver Works is only for Woody completists. As for the rest, go for it.
@jaykeith I asked and Grenier and Connolly just laughed and laughed. Draw your own conclusions.
@emmeloowhoo Paquin says she's never seen or read Twilight. Seems that True Blood Tv creator Alan Ball didn't want his cast to be influenced

At The Movies With Peter Travers: "Terminator: Salvation," "The Girlfriend Experience" and "Night at the Museum".. http://tinyurl.com/r3vfok
@The_Mike_Cook Maybe. But Adam loses to Kris, the Oscar goes to Crash not Brokeback, the lesbian doc vanishes from Grey's Anatomy. Hello!
Cannes critics were tough on Quentin's Inglourious Basterds‚Äî2 violent, talky and obsessed with movies. Sounds good to me. How about you?
America voted and the new name for everyone's favorite TV singing competition is: "Homophobic American Idol."
Idol Question: Was it Adam or Kris who best survived singing "No Boundaries," an atrocity from judge Kara that needs a stake in the heart.
@bricegramm I asked McG your question on camera. Intriguing answer, but 2 long  for a Tweet. I'll do a blog on it. Thanks again.
@rainnwilson I'm waiting! Or was it enuf that you let me touch Dustin Hoffman's gum?
Rainn Wilson just stopped by my office at Rolling Stone.  I told him if he didn't start following me on Twitter I would toss my Rocker DVD
Interviewing McG tomorrow for my ABC Popcorn show about directing Terminator Salvation. It'll be more fun with questions from Twiiterverse.

Grimaldi's wins for its Pepperoni pizza. Loved the atmosphere. Alan Richman picks the top 25 US pizzas soon in GQ. Bastard won't tell me.
Pizza question 2: my food critic friend Alan Richman wants to know what's the best pizza you guys ever had? Go tweeters , go1
Pizza Question: who remembers a movie where pizza plays a major part in the action? And don't say "Mystic Pizza"!
Pizza Adventure 2: off to Grimaldi's, a Brooklyn institution. Long line. Richman, me and my son Alex are getting good vibe. Fingers crossed,
Pizza Disaster 3. Pizza arrives-finally! Crust is tasteless. And crust is crucial, Bacon and avocado,an Ignazio special,just don't blend!
Pizza Disaster 2: Ignazio's forget to put in our order! Half hour wait now doubled! Richman furious! Great view though of Brooklyn Bridge!

Scorsese will direct a Sinatra biopic. Can't wait.  Some fear he'll cast Leo DiCaprio. Who'd you pick? Depp could do it. Downey? Who else?

@alexrtravers I'm beginning to think so. It's either dead Bart or lively Dorota!
Ewan McGregor says there's someone on Twitter pretending to be him. It's not him, and he doesn't like it.
Cannes Film Festival just opened with Pixar's animated "Up" in 3D. You should know that "Up" is another Pixar miracle. How do they do it?
On my way to a screening of Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell." Hoping it's a return to the cheap thrills of "Evil Dead."
@IIIMSIII Ewan said working with Ron Howard was the best part. Worst thing is is he can't talk about his role without giving away the plot.
@sachalecca Still pissed. Thanks for the question. Ewan's answer was very emotional. It made me want to stage an intervention. 2 good guys.
Idol Crisis: Who thinks Adam slipped last nite? u2? Danny hit grace notes on You Are So Beautiful. Kris's Heartless was best in show. Uh-oh
Interviewing Ewan McGregor  Wed. for my ABC Popcorn show. High on him since toilet swim in Trainspotting. Got questions for Ewan? Send em.
DVD Must: Galaxy Quest, out today in a 10th anniversary disc, hilariously spoofs all things Star Trek.  By Grabthar's hammer, it rocks.
Anyone notice how post-Twilght films for Rob Pattinson (Little Ashes) and Kristen Stewart (Adventureland) are slow death at the box office?
Gossip Girl last nite worst ever.Am I right? Messed up Blair's big prom moment with spinoff-begging flashbacks to Serena's mom in the 1980s.
@mr_popcorn He totally wants the Arrested Development movie to happen. But waiting on Mitch Hurwitz is finish the script.
@spaceyfan Ron H thinks it may not as well.
@AliSoma Not a thing. Ron H insists a group of Vatican nuns saw Angels & Demons and declared it "harmless fun." I second that emotion.
@jessicacohn Answer is long but hilarious, esp when the director asked him to "put on his party face." In the video that means NO SMILING!

@alexrtravers Actually it's the Greenwich dining scene
Hosting a Rolling Stone lunch with director Ron Howard today. Speak now if you have any questions for him.
Second salute is the dick-out-of-box "Motherlover," the hilarious SNL duet by Timberlake and Samberg. Should become a Mom's Day perenial
Salute to movie moms this Mother's Day starts with Winona Ryder, 37, playing mumsie to Spock Zachary Quinto, 31. Talk about starting early!
@tenlux I say yes but you have to mark on a curve.
@troylsmith yoi're right, the Spanish accents were horrible. Whole movie would play better with the sound off.
Rob Pattinson resembles Idol contender Adam Lambert in first scene as Dali in "Little Ashes", a movie getting trashed more than it deserves.
@hippeesooz The logical side that knows Star Trek movies don't make big money in the US and fizzle around the rest of the globe.
Can Star Trek hit a $100 mill opening and break records?  The Vulcan in me says it's illogical. But the human in me is hot to see it happen.
@hippeesooz Love that answer!

@nesvrstani It's there now in RS and online. Thanks for asking.
Mega-talented Allison voted off Idol proving the Forrest Gump point America that "stupid is as stupid does."

Just for the record: "Star Trek" really is THAT good.

Can't say I'm sad at Wolverine bonanza. Hugh Jackman rises above the mess. But $15 million for Ghosts of McConaugheys Past? That's tragic!
@sistermedia Just show you know: Depp's great-grandmother was Cherokee. So the casting isn't that off the ethnic bar.
@KevinSpacey You were so right about Norman Conquests. Teriffic in all departments, Good luck on Tony Tuesday.
@mjgprod I know! Obsessed is just 2 PG13 careful.  Showgirls is recklessly bad. That's why it's so good!
Johnny Depp is in line to play Tonto in the big-screen "Lone Ranger." But who's the Masked Man? I vote Josh Brolin. Who'd you pick?
@mjgprod Can't wait to hear your reaction.
@katriord Gracias mucho. . Loved hearing Nimoy's explanation. But I still can't do it. Damn!
Depressed that limp-dick Wolverine kicks off the movie summer? Wait till next weekend when the new "Star Trek" does it right. Really right.
Am I alone thinking Carla Gugino (Entourage) should be a megastar.  Just saw her on stage in "Desire Under the Elms." Two words: Tony Award.
"Wolverine" opening weekend is pegged at $70 million and up! Can it top Iron Man's debut at $102 million last summer? Doesn't deserve to.
Bad Movie Friday: There's always one. Today it's "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" with McConaughey trashing his career as an oversexed Scrooge.

Obsession 6: Apologies for calling Beyonce's non-thriller by the wrong name. It's "Obsessed." And it's awful.
@LaurenMoreau I expected it to be fun bad,  like "Uninvited."  But "Obsession" was just a dud. It bored me breathless.
Obsession 5: Scary thought. This brain snatcher will be No. 1 at the box office this weekend.  I know it. Fight back, people, stay home.
Obsessed 4: Movie over. Hell to sit thru. Beyonce sings over credits. Only good thing to say.  Back to office to review. It won't be pretty.
Obsessed 3: No movie yet-just crap ads (we pay for this!) and crap trailers (Gift 2, please),about a dozen. They outnumber customers.Damn!
Obsessed 2: Bought ticket for 11am show. Usher says it's 2 beautiful out for movies. "Any movie or just this one" I ask. Think I scared her.
Bad Movie Friday: No advance screening for Beyonce in "Obsessed" means I'm heading out to buy a ticket and report back.  Never say die!

Best Musical on Broadway? "Next To Normal" puts bipolar manic-depression to a rock beat and kicks hard.  Screw Billy Elliot.
Best movie around now? Grey Gardens on HBO. Think you've seen Drew Barrymore before? You have not. Drew and Jessica Lange just nail it.

Monday box office reports obvious win for "Monsters vs Aliens." Too bad that the 3D and Seth Rogen are the only good things about it.
Just out of LaBute's Reasons to be Pretty. Best play on Broadway rite now. Best look at how we screw each other up in relationships.
I'm introing LaBute's first movie, 1997's "In the Company of Men" on Thurs at Museum of Modern Art. Wonder if he's mellowed? Hope not!
On my way to 3pm matin√©e of Neil Le Bute's "reasons to be pretty." It's his first play to hit Broadway. I'm expecting fireworks!
Cobin  worries that Hollywood will screw up the US redo. He's probably right. The French did great with Tell No One, out Tues on DVD Get it!
Just met ace mystery writer Harlen Coben at brunch. All over him with questions about "Tell No One," his book the French made into fab movie
Carnage reminds me of weird Mickey D "give me that fish" TV spot. Who else Is freaked by that singin fish? it's scarier than Haunting in CT

Usher says the same thing to everyone. Of course we're here for God of Carnage! What else? He keeps repeating it. Nuts! Now I'm saying it
About to see Jamea Gandolfini in Broadway play. Usher asks "You here for God of Carnage? Then adds,"Enjoy the carnage and the chaos." Whaat!
I told Rogen if kids saw his twisted mall cop in Observe & Report expecting Paul Blart, they'd freak and cry,he said "Good I hate kids."
Rogen and I stand near a poster of him as BOB the blob in Monsters cd Aliens. He says they have similar genitals. Actually points to them.
Seth Rogen says he will play media boss Britt Reid, the Hornet's alter ego,as a douchebag. He says he'll base the character on himself.
Meet with Rogen. Flab gone to play Green Hornet this summer. Says he lost it thru diet and a killer trainer. Bummer. I wanted a magic potion
Horror finally over. Will file review later. Cabbing it to ABC to interview Seth Rogen for my Popcorn show. Want to ask about Green Hornet.
Film breaks. Most exciting thing to happen so far in a movie that uses every cheap haunted house trick. Audience still screams. Go figure.
Tons of trailers. "Crank 2" does not look good. Movie starts with Based on The True Story. Sure signs it's bogus.
Two more ticket buyers come in. One asked the usher if this is "Miss March.' Oddly she says YES!
