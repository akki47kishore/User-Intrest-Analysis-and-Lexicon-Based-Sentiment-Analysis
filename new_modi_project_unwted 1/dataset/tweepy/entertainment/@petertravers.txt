And so the Globes give Moonlight the edge over Manchester By the Sea as we go into the Oscars. Both great. But La La Land seems unstoppable.
Casey Affleck richly deserves every acting award he wins, even a Golden Dildo.
Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, Damien Chazelle. A good night for La La Land, even it's coming from the worst source.
Meryl Streep raises the bar on the Globes by taking on Trump without ever mentioning his name, just the scary future he represents.
Tom Hiddleston wins for Night Manager, joining costars Hugh Laurie and Olivia Coleman. A terrific show. But Courtney Vance, you were robbed.
Damien Chazelle wins Globe for his  La La Land screenplay. Love that movie. But Kenneth Lonergan did wonders with Manchester By the Sea.
Ryan Gosling wins for La La Land. Wait. Did the Globes just get one right?
Viola Davis wins for Fences. Who can argue with that?
John Lithgow loses Globe to Hugh Laurie. What are these Globe voters drinking?

Inarritu joins John Ford and Joe Mankiewicz as the only directors to win back to back Oscars. But no one has won back to back 4 Best Picture
Oscar ends its 3 hour and 36 minute show with "Fight the Power." I'm assuming that's meant for people of color. A long road ahead.
Much to my joy, Spotlight triumphs over The Revenant for Best Picture. It was a ragged, slog of a show. But the right movie won. Yes!
Leo wins, at last. No surprise. But the fire and intelligence of his acceptance speech, that nailed it.
Brie Larson wins Best Actress for Room. The award was expected by so well and truly earned.
Alejandro Inarritu wins directing Oscar twice in a row. His articulate speech, one of the few worthy of remembering, is cut off w music!
The great Ennio Morricone wins his first scoring Oscar for The Hateful Eight. Talk about what took you so long. Genius.
Sam Smith's meh song from Spectre beats Gaga's anthem from The Hunting Groubd. Wait, what? Are you kidding?
intro'd byJoe Biden, Lady Gaga delivers a passionate version of "Till It Happens to You" with backup from other rape survivors. Bravo.
Amy wins Best Documentary and deserves it.
Thanks Louis CK for being funny and pointed in introducing Documentary Short Subject.
Night's biggest shocker. Mark Rylance beats Stallone for Best Supporting Actor. You could complain. Would it help? A gracious speech.
Chris Rock's visit to a Compton multiplex is so funny it hurts. No one's heard of any of the nominated movies.
Inside-Out deserves its Animated Oscar. But so did Anomalisa. Sorry.
Passed out for a minute and saw Chris Rock selling Girl Scout cookies and all the Oscar presenters turned animated.
Room  star Jacob Tremblay,9, looked excited to see the Star Wars robots on the Oscar stage. At least someone looked alive.Dull is sinking in
Nice moment seeing Margaret Sixel winning Best Editing for her husband George Miller's Mad Max.
Also supremely well deserved.
Three Oscars in a row for Lubezki. Chivo makes history with The Revenant.
"And the should have been nominated Michael B Jordan." Great intro from Chris Rock
Three technical Oscars in s row for the great Mad Max Fury Road and yet it has no chance for Best Picture and director George Miller. Stupid
Alicia Vikander wins Supporting Actress Oscar for Danish Girl and actually kisses boyfriend Michael Fassbender in public.
Spotlight and Big Short win Screenplay Oscars. Will they be the last awards these 2 great films win?

The Revenant grabs surprise win as Best Drama and might change the Oscar chances of Spotlight if the Globes meant a damn thing. They don't.
Leo DiCaprio wins Globe for Actor Drama and the audience applause should carry him home to Oscar. Very nice speech.
Brie Larson proves a popular choice as Best Actress for Room. No argument here.
Did I just seeTarantino chatting with Cate Blanchett whose movies he recently ridiculed? Well, I'll be.
2-time Globe winner Jim Carrey gives Comedy prize to The Martian, not a comedy at all. Big Short suffers a slight setback on road to Oscar.
Jennifer Lawrence was good in Joy, but Amy Schumer and Lily Tomlin deserved the Globe more. Sorry, haters:
Taraji P. Henson wins her Globe as the immortal Cookie Lyon in Empire. And hands out cookies. Good one.
Morgan Freeman gives Director Globe to Alejandro G. Inarritu  for The Revenant. George Miller and Ridley Scott, I personally salute you.
Tom Hanks gives great intro for Denzel Washington, the winner of DeMille award. Never seen Denzel that shaken.
Mr. Robot wins Best Drama Globe. Me? I couldn't be happier. The shoutout to Rami Malek so deserved.
Katy Perry gives Globe for Best Song to Sam Smith for Writing's On the Wall" from Spectre. A surprise given the song's meh reviews.
Lady Gaga wins acting Globe for American Horror Story. A genuine, heartfelt speech, but Queen Latifah got robbed for Bessie.
Son of Saul wins Foreign Film Globe, first ever prize for Hungary. And a great film by any measure.
Gael Garcia Bernal wins Globe for Mozart in the Jungle. Again, the Globes honor new work. Congrats.
Screenplay Globe goes, as it should, to Aaron Sorkin for Steve Jobs. A movie that I thought was forgotten.
Stallone gets his expected Globe for Creed and thanks everyone but the film's true talent, director Ryan Coogler. Wait, what!
Kurt Russell and step-daughter Kate Hudson give Inside-Out its deserved Globe for animation.
Matt Damon wins Best Actor Comedy for The Martian. Fill in your own joke.
Besties Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence present their own movies. I'm thinking Amy's remarks cut by the censors must have been funny.
Jon Hamm gets the Globe for last season of Mad Men. Ok, I guess. But Rami Malek  of Mr. Robot gets my vote.
Quentin Tarantino accepts composer award for the great Ennio Morricone for Hateful Eight.
ChristianSlater wins Globe for the terrific Mr. Robot. Alright!
Oscar Isaac wins Globe for Show Me a Hero. No mention of being in Star Wars.
Wolf Hall beats Fargo for the Globe. Bad call. Fargo is the Greatest!
Gervais intros Matt Damon as "the only person Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to." Good one.
Gotta hand it to the Globes for their TV https://t.co/YPggeMXisK stuff like Rachel Bloom and Mozart in the Jungle!
Maura Tierney also a surprise winner for The Affair. But how damn good she was this season.
Kate Winslet wins Golden Globe for Steve Jobs. She "extremely surprised," as are we all. Pleasantly.
Should win Golden Globes: Spotlight, Big Short, Schumer, Saoirse Ronan, Damon,Fassbender, Paul Dano, Vikander, George Miller. Which won't?

Party time here. Julianne Moore wins as expected. Redmayne beats Keaton. Ouch. Birdman beats Boyhood. Super Ouch! But that's Hollywood!
Affleck gives Best Director Oscar that he wasn't nominated for Argo to Inarritu for Birdman. The die is cast.
"Stay weird. Stay different" becomes the unofficial mantra of OSCAR  2015. Thanks Graham Moore.
Oprah gives Adapted Screenplay to Imitation Game. Graham Moore talks of wanting to kill himself at 16. His heartfelt speech honors the film.
Eddie Murphy gives Original Screenplay to Birdman. Smart money was on Budapest. But after Gaga, all bets are off. Is Wes clapping?
I'm sorry. The segment with Lady Gaga channeling a nun with ink sent me into feeling like I'm in the Twilight Zone. Was that Julie Andrews?
Nice comic touch that Travolta  and Idina Menzel present the Best Song OSCAR.
Ironic. the Best Song winner honors a great movie with impassioned words from Common and John Legend that honor the power of music &amp; film

Meryl hands Best Drama to Boyhood. All is well with the world. But the show is way 2 respectable. For dull, we have the Oscars!
Actor Drama goes to Eddie Redmayne for Theory of Everything. Eddie is a charmer, who is an actor to his bones. Ditto the other 4 nominees.
McConaughey hands Actress Drama to a very excited Julianne Moore 4 Still Alice. A happy person has work and love. Congrats!
Robert Downey Jr. gives Comedy Globe to, surprise, Grand Budapest Hotel. Funny speech from Wes Anderson, but Birdman was robbed!
Comedy Actor win to Michael  Keaton in Birdman. He chokes up talking about his best friend, his son Sean. How do you not love this dude?
Actress TV Drama goes to Ruth Wilson in The Affair. Wish I could connect to that show. I can't.
Harrison Ford hands the directing Globe to Richard Linklater for Boyhood. I'm smiling.
Newlywed George Clooney, 53, gets early DeMille Life Achievement award. A humanist. A class act. When he says "Je Suis Charlie" he means it.
Actor TV Series Drama goes to Kevin Spacey 4 House of Cards. He must be very happy Breaking Bad ended its run. 1st win after 8 noms.
TV Series Drama goes The Affair when Good Wife, House of Cards, Game of Thrones and almost everything else far exceed it.
TV Actress goes to Maggie Gyllenhaal 4  Honorable Woman, leaving Frances McDormand award-less for being the very best in Olive Kitteridge!
Globe 4 Foreign Film goes to Leviathan, a Russian drama I just learned is pronounced la-bee-a-thin!
Where are the stoners &amp; drunks? The zglobes are getting as bland and self-serious as the Oscars. Where are the train wrecks?
Fonda &amp; Tomlin present TV Comedy actor to Jeffrey Tambor 4 Transparent and prove again the Globe folks know what's what when it comes to TV
Hader &amp; Wiig, struggling with lousy material,give Screenplay Globe to Birdman and Alejandro Innaritu butchers English beautifully.
Liked Patricia Arquette's crack about getting a hug from Meryl Streep and hoping her DNA would rub off on her.
Jared Leto gives Supporting Actress Globe to Patricia Arquette in Boyhood and her words, even from a crib sheet, hits all the right notes.
Globe for Animated film goes to HowTo Train a Dragon 2, meaning Lego Movie didn't translate to the Hollywood Foreign Press?
Acerbic Ricky Gervais, bless him, gives Globe 4 Comedy to Amy Adams for Big Eyes leaving Emily Blunt to wonder how she went into the woods.
Globe for Supporting Actor goes so deservedly to Matt Bomer in Normal Heart, a TV movie as good as anything the big screen is turning out.
Prince, getting a standing O, gives song Globe to "Glory" from Selma. Good on Common &amp; John Legend. Their thank Us actually have meaning.
Globe for movie score goes to Theory of Everything when Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross showed how it's really done in Gone Girl.
Globe for TV Comedy Series goes to Transparent,a new series with guts that puts the Globes  ahead of the stodgy Emmys for cheering the new.
Globe for TV Comedy Actress goes to Gina Rodriquez for Jane the Virgin. Well deserved and first sincerely great speech of the night.
Selfie with fake North Korean journalist and Streep and Keaton falls flat. Where's Ellen when we need her?
TV Actor Globe goes to Billy Bob Thornton for Fargo, not McConaughey or Ruffalo. Not liking the way this is going.
Globe for TV Mini goes  to Fargo instead of Normal Heart or True Detective. Bad choice.
First Brit win of the night is Joanne Froggatt  for playing Lady Mary's maid in Downton Abbey. Nice one. But no one seems drunk yet. Damn!
Supporting Actor goes as it should to JK Simmons in Whiplash. Sometimes there really is no other way to go but to the best.

Lingering Oscar Question: why did 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen and screenwriter  John Ridley not thank or mention each other ?
To sum up: a slogging OSCAR show of no surprises but intensely satisfying victors. 12  Years a Slave now belongs to history. It was time.
Will Smith, RAZZIE winner, presents Best Picture to 12 Years. The first film about the black experience to win in the Academy's 86 years.
Jennifer "why are you laughing" Lawrence presents Best Actor to McConaughey. No surprise. But all right. All right All right! Great speech
Daniel Day Lewis Lincoln presents Actress to fellow Brit Cate Blanchett, who champions women and Australia with vigor and class.
Director Oscar fr Jolie &amp; a fragile Sidney Poitier to Alfonso Cuaron for Gravity. Mexico triumphs. And the wise guys at Warner bros.
Screenplay awards from a funny DeNiro:  Adapted to John Ridley for 12 Years. Original to Spike Jonze for Her. American Hustle loses again.
I'll have what Jamie Foxx is having, presenting  Musical Score to Gravity &amp; Best Song to,yes,Let It Go. Robert Lopez &amp; wife accept in rhyme.
Idina Menzel powerfully belts  "Let It Go" from Frozen into the presumed winner's circle.
Goldie Hawn gives us meaningless clips from the last  3 nominees for Best Picture. It's over. Unless more hero montages are coming.
Glenn Close intros In Memorium, from Gandolfini to Phil Hoffman. Bette Midler finishes with "Wind Beneath My Wings". Standing O for Miss M.

Production Design goes to Great Gatsby. Has a lousy movie ever looked this beautiful?
Pink sings tribute to Wizard of Oz. Don't know why, what with Liza  &amp; Lorna in the audience. No complaints. Trumpet tonsils, that Pink.
Gravity also wins Best Editng. I smell a sweep.Cuaron is cut off by music . Nice one. All the time in the world for Ellen and pizza.
Amy Adams, looking like $146 million domestic re Bill Murray (nice shoutout to Harold Ramis, Bill), gives cinematography Oscar to Gravity!

Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, 50 years old this week, lost the '64 Oscar to My Fair Lady. For a statue made of gold, Oscar has a damn soft head
Globes Wrap: McConaughey &amp; Cuaron into the Oscars with new heat. Streep &amp; Roberts need to play catchup. P Diddy &amp; Jackie Bisset need coffee.
Johnny Depp gives Best Drama Globe to, rightly, 12 Years a Slave. And so we go into the Oscars as a race between 12 Years &amp; American Hustle.
Jessica Chastain presents Best Actor to Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club. All right. All right. Go get it.
Leo presents Best Actress to Cate Blanchett who gets rightly pissed at the damned music that keeps playing people off .

Drew Barrymore presents American Hustle with the Best Comedy Globe. The win was expected. Now onto the Oscars.
Nice intro for Rush from Chris Hemsworth  and the real Nicki Lauda . But shouldn't nominee Daniel Bruhl who played Lauda have presented?
JLaw presents Leo DiCaprio Comedy Actor Globe and he accepts with humor and grace, especially the shoutout to the great Bruce Dern.

How many times can Kerry Washington keep losing awards? Unfair. But Robin Wright is a class act. So no complaints.
Jackie Bisset now becoming the joke of the night. Tina/Amy joke works!
Funny presenter speech from Robert Downey Jr. Amy Adams so deserved that Best Actress award. Meryl can 't win them all.
Jon Voight's Globe win for Ray Donovon puts a real smile on my face. Great performance
Great to see P Diddy present Globes with intoxicating exuberance that borders on the incoherence we expect from the Hollywood Foreign Press

@MW_514 sure thing!
Lame Seth McFarlane/Chenowith duet so makes me miss Neil Patrick Harris. And why no cameras in the audience? Here's to the losers, indeed!
Affleck speech from the heart. Though telling your wife that your marriage has been work? That's debatable.
Argo takes the Big One! Ben Affleck not getting nominated for directing wins him the race. Lincoln has been effectively marginalized. Wow!
Bringing  in the First Lady to intro the Best Film nominees? Is this a spoof of all the DC interference this year?
Did Streep open the envelope before? Either way Daniel Day Lewis  becomes 1st actor to win 3 Best Actor Oscars. Also, best, wittiest speech.
Jennifer Lawrence finds her silver lining. A breathless speech. But where's the mischief?
Jean Dujardin totally charming!
Why are Oscar cameras so bad this year at giving us faces in the audience? Wanted to see those directing nominees &amp; those not nominated.
Ang Lee wins directing Oscar for Life of Pi. Take that Spielberg! Loved his wife's expression when he said they'll be married 30 years.
QT takes the Oscar for Django. Even GWTW playoff music can't shut him up. You gotta love this guy.
Chris Terrio wins Oscar for Argo beating Tony Kushner's stellar screenplay for Lincoln. To which I say WTF
Adele crying real tears after winning for Skyfall. So far, I'm not feeling it.
How about you?
Sneaking in those  2 song nominees like an afterthought and then dragging out Norah Jones for a stage wait. Stay classy, Oscar.
Streisand sings Way We Were in honor of Marvin Hamlisch. Even hoarse and wavering, the voice has emotional heft.
George Clooney intros the memorials. Seeing my friend Lois Smith, publicist extraordinaire and human being supreme, heartbreaking.
Lincoln wins an award. It's production design but still.
Adele sings the hell out of Skyfall while the camera diverts focus with crazy montages. So stupid. Oscars now become the Grammys.
Argo wins first award of night for editing. Here we go!
Plummer gives the night's most predictable award to Hathaway. Speech is a disappointing laundry list of thank yous. Where's the drama?
A dramatic tie and it's for Sound! Zero Dark Thirty and Skyfall. Couldn't they have saved that for best picture?
Les Miz turns the Oscars into the Tony awards. Brave man that Russell Crowe!
Zeta lip syncs. Hudson sings live. Big diference.
Amour wins foreign language film. No surprise there. But will it win more?
Searching for Sugar Man wins best doc. WhooHoo!
Poor Liam Neeson having to intro a scene from Lincoln. Before DDL he had the role.
Shirley Bassey singing Goldfinger is truly indestructible. Deserved standing O. The Bond montage was meh.
We're the makeup and hair winners actually seated in the theater? They seemed so far away!
.
Costumes award perfectly deserved by Anna Karenina. And they didn't blow the winner off with Jaws. R they learning?
Rudest playoff ever for Life of Pi team. Jaws music? Really?
Life of Pi looking good going in!
All respect to Life of Li, but Will Roger Deakins never win an Oscar?
Waltz win in support instead of the unsmiling Tommy Lee Jones doesn't bode well for Lincoln.

Here's my take on the #OscarNoms. Reply with your thoughts and #DamnYouOscar http://t.co/UY2eeqhm
True that! RT @meganeellison: Kathryn Bigelow was robbed. So fucked up. #recount
Who thinks the directing snubs for Bigelow and Affleck might help them win votes in the Best Picture race? Fingers crossed.
The only think dumber and more cowardly  Oscar can do is sign the Kardasians to host the show next year.
Did Best Picture nominee Django Unchained direct itself?
Did Best Picture nominee Argo direct itself?
Did Best Picture nominee Zero Dark Thirty direct itself?
Did the old boys club deny Bigelow an Oscar nod bec she won for Hurt Locker. R they done with the fem thing? Once every 100 years,that's it?
Oscar noms hit a new low in stupid: No Bigelow for directing? What?  No Affleck. No Tarantino. No Master. No Dark Knight Rises. Shameful!

Jean Dujardin's surprise SAG win last night as Best Actor for The Artist just put some much needed heat into a too predictable Oscar race.
RIP Damien Bona whose smart, irreverent 'Inside Oscar' books (written with the late Mason Wiley) are indispensable. So long, my friend.
Heads up: "Chronicle" opening on a Friday is teen movie you really  DON'T want to ignore. Who knew?
If "The Artist" wins the Screen Actors Guild award tonight for Ensemble, can any other film pull an upset and win the Best Picture Oscar?
"Arbitrage" is the best premiere film I saw at Sundance with an Oscar-worthy Richard Gere and director Nick Jarecki channeling Sidney Lumet
Benh Zeitlin's "Beasts of  the Southern Wild" wins jury prize at Sundance. Ben Lewin's "The Surrogate" wins the audience. Terrific choices.
At Sundance, Paul Simon tells me "Drive" is the film he admired most last year. I knew I liked that guy.

'The Grey' is a terrifically exciting, deeply unsettling survivalist epic that makes us face our own worst fears: http://t.co/PiNIhFIK
Oscar snubs Alberts Brooks/Drive. Ditto Fassbender for Shame, Shannon for Take Shelter & Swinton for Kevin. A new definition for ignorance.
Extremely Loud and incredibly trite gets a Best Picture nomination but Drive does not. Kill me now!
Oscar could have had 10 best picture nominations but went with 9, eliminating Bridesmaids. What's the message there?
Gary Oldman's best actor Oscar nod this am for Tinker  put a smile on my face I can't wipe off. So well deserved.
Acting doesn't get much better than the subtly brilliant display from Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin: http://t.co/M52EErvr

RIP Sidney Lumet. From 12 Angry Men to Before the Devil, a master director. A dream interview. A true friend. An incalculable loss for film.
'Arthur' and 'Your Highness' are DOA. Better picks for this wknd's movies: 'Hanna' or 'Meek's Cutoff.' Here's why: http://bit.ly/hKGZFp

Worst. Oscars. Ever. The much-promised "young and hip" telecast fell on its skinny, high-fashion ass last night: http://bit.ly/fEStva
5th grade chorus from Bronx sings Over the Rainbow reminding 
us that sentiment is Oscar's guiding force. Maybe that's why we expect less.
The King's Speech wins Best Picture. Justice is not done. The Academy again mistakes Oscar night for Valentine's Day.
Best Picture at last. Spielberg makes losing seem preferable. Social Network can join Citizen Kane, Grapes of Wrath and Raging Bull.
Sandra Bullock hands the inevitable Colin Firth Oscar to Colin Firth. If only the former ' child sensation' gave in to his instinct to dance
Jeff Bridges presents Best Actress award to Natalie Portman. No surprise there. But Bening was robbed.
Coppola, Brownlaw and Wallach get their deserved standing ovation. Godard stays home and pouts.
Annette Bening presents Governor's awards. Is that the Academy's way of telling us Bening isn't winning?
Kathryn Bigelow hands Director award to Tom Hooper for King's Speech. My dreams go up in smoke.
Celine Dion sings a tribute to those who died in last year. And Halle Berry offers her own fitting tribute to Lena Horne.
Randy Newman gives truly funny speech. I still hate the Song category.
Song again. Florence does the 127 Hours. Paltrow does Country Strong dirge. Jennifer Hudson says it's Toy Story3. I say dump the category.
More forced banter between Franco & Hathaway. Mike Myers already made the Winter's Bone joke on SNL.
Best Editing goes to Social Network. Am I dreaming? Is the tide shifting to the real best picture of the year?
Hello Billy, to have you back where you belong! Nice nod to Bob Hope.Downey & Jude Law do Special Effects. Inception again, of course.
Oprah presents Best Doc. Coen brothers look to be napping. But winner is Inside Job. I wanted Banksy!
segment with Harry P, Toy Story 3, Social Network and Twilight as musicals falls flat.
Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal do Short films. Right, Jake, they kill you on Oscar pools. Winners Strangers No More & God of Love prove point.
Spacey sings! And intros Randy Newman Song from Toy Story 3. Then I See the Light fr  Tangled. Mandy Moore looking hot. What's doin there?
Cate also presents Costumes to Alice in Wonderland. Is The King's Speech losing momentum?
Marisa Tomei intros technical prizes. Cate Blanchet does Makeup. The Wolf Man wins. "Gross," says Cate. It's also a grossly bad movie.
Scarlet Jo and McConaughay present Sound mixing to Inception. And Sound Editing also to Chris Nolan's modern classic. Bravo!
2 Aussies Hugh Jackman & Nicole Kidman present Score to Reznor/Ross for Social Network. The  only correct choice.
Christian Bale wins.Bloody Hell. Well deserved. Great speech. "Where's my Quaker? Dickeklund.com"
Reese Witherspoon presents Best supporting actor. What, last year's best supporting actress Monique was busy? What happened to tradition?
Russell Brand  & Helen Mirren are actually funny. Denmark's In a Better World wins. I got that one right. So did the Academy.
Hathaway rips Hugh Jackman with song from Les Miz.  Franco as MM is scary. It almost works. Almost.
Late bloomer David Seidler gives first witty speech of the night. Stutterers have indeed been heard.
Original Screenplay goes to King's Speech. So the Social Network versus The King continues unabated.
Loved Sorkin's reference to Paddy Chayefsky and Network.
Javier Bardem & Josh Brolin, dressed as waiters, give Adapted Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin\ Social Network. Any other choice be absurd.
Who besides me is getting the vibe that this Oscar show is going to spring a few surprises?
Animated Feature goes, as expected, to Toy Story 3. And yes it would be cool to see Banksy.
Justin Timberlake is not Banksy. But who is? Animated short goes to 
Lost Thing. Is JT tweaking Kirk Douglas?
Melissa Leo gets bleeped! WTF?
Kirk Douglas presents Supporting Actress to Melissa Leo. I am very pleased!
Great to see Chris Nolan applauding his cinematographer. Nolan deserves more credit than Oscar chose to give him.
Inception wins Cinematography. No sweep for anything in sight.
Tom Hanks presents Art direction & Cinematography. Will it be a King's Speech sweep? Guess not. Alice in Wonderland wins Art Direction.
"James, you look appealing to a younger demographic as well." Good one, Hathaway.
Oscar starts by inserting hosts Franco & Hathaway into best picture nominees. Cute, but Billy Crystal did it funnier.
@questlove Well that makes my weekend. Thanks Q

Hollywood biggies up for Tony awards tonite‚ÄîDenzel, Zeta, Scarlett Jo, Walken, Jude Law‚Äîbut it's still the lousiest year in Broadway memory.

Right now, the Joan Rivers documentary, "A Piece of Work," is the funniest movie you can see anywhere. Hear it. Believe it. See it.
The return of HBO's True Blood Sunday puts Anna Sookie Paquin close to vamp sheriff Alexander Skarsgard. The sizzle meter goes way past 11
Both of today's 80's throwbacks, A-Team & Karate Kid, stumble. But I'll take the A-Team's  junky fun over the Kid's self-serious posturing.

Scorsese's Shutter Island on DVD & Blu-Ray today. Grab it. This thriller demands and rewards a 2nd look. How do you interpret that ending?
Can Avatar make up for losing Oscar by winning MTV award tonite as Best Movie? Or will Twilight, Alice, Harry Potter or Hangover take it?
Idol winner Lee Dewyze sparked my Twitterverse by picking Shawshank as best prison movie. Lots of you think Cool Hand Luke. What say, Lee?
@bengriffith Ben, I'd have to put in a vote for another landmark Kubrick film on war: Paths of Glory.
HBO doc on the late John Cazale (Fredo in Godfather) is an unmissable lesson in acting. Touching commentary from Pacino, Buscemi & Streep.
Idol runnerup and single mom Crystal Bowersox says she doesn't see many movies but loved Once, Hi Fidelity and Romeo & Juliet (Leo version).
American Idol winner Lee Dewyze told me at lunch today that his favorite film is Shawshank Redemption. Is it the best prison movie ever?
@benmshields Amen to that, brother!
@HarlanCoben Agreed, my friend, but Torino made more bucks than any flick Clint acted in. How bout Eastwood as director of Caught? Good fit?
Clint Eastwood turns 80 today. Happy B-day Kid. Best acting? I say Unforgiven, In the Line of Fire & a nod to the underrated Tightrope. You?

Best box-office news is not the inevitable hit of dead Elm St. but the success of Please Give, a sharp comedy burning up the indie circuit.
Deep sympathy to the family of Lynn Redgrave, an incandescent talent from  Georgy Girl to Gods & Monsters and a true woman of heart and mind

If you're planning to see JLo in Backup Plan this weekend,  I say get a backup plan. Try the  Argentinian thriller The Secret in Their Eyes.
Al Pacino does his best acting since Angels in America in HBO's Dr. Kevorkian drama, You Don't Know Jack. Not an ounce of hoo-haw in it.
@alexqsmith Seriously, Alex, I think Johnny Depp would be a knockout Lisbeth in the Hollywood remake.

Big ratings for Glee return last nite. Jane Lynch is queen of the world. Plus Broadway royalty Jonathan Groff & Idina Menzel hit the spot.
@alexrtravers Indeed!
Campbell Scott, on TV in Damages and onscreen in Handsome Harry proves he's currently the most underrated actor making artistry look easy.
Who's been watching Treme on HBO? If not, get busy. This look at New Orleans post Katrina from The Wire's David Simon shames Hollywood crap.
On DVD: The Landlord. Hal Ashby (1929-1988) went to seed. But his great films (Harold & Maude,Last Detail,Shampoo,Being There) began here.

People who think the sham retrofitted 3D of Clash of the Titans is on par with Avatar need immediate eye and brain surgery. Please!
Also fits Clash of Titans! RT @Margoandhow: Great phrase: "extra special stupid." Said by Chelsea Handler re tattoo lady with Bullock hubby
Michael Bay retires from filmmaking! It's only April Fool, but I wish.
Release the Kraken on the cross promotion of Clash of the Titans on American Idol is a new low in hype. And Titans in fake 3D truly sucks!
@balbespi The Antichrist has been threatening for years to desecrate Rosemary's Baby. So far nothing. Doesn't Polanski have enuf problems!
Best new DVD you never heard of: Uli Edel's "Baader Meinhof Complex," a whipsmart thriller about a German terrorist group of the 1970s.
DVD Pick: An Education, a teen girl/older man romance. Carey Mulligan is so good Ms Bullock should return her Oscar to its rightful owner.
If you were one of those who shelled out a stiff $18 a ticket to see "How To Train Your Dragon" on IMAX 3D, did you think it was worth it?
As "24" finishes up on TV & preps a feature film, I salute Season 5 as best with Jean Smart as the nutso 1st Lady to Gregory Itzin's Prez.

Oscar rejects Hollywood's fattest hit and rewards low grosser Hurt Locker with it's top prize. Self loathing or something else? Discuss.
Tom Hanks presents one from the  10 Best picture nominees. it's Hurt Locker! Oscar went with quality not the box office. I'll be damned!
Streisand presents director prize to, yes, a woman! Bigelow makes history. The time has come indeed! No direct mention of her ex husband!
And Sean Penn hands the Oscar to Bullock. "Did I really earn this or just wear you all down?" Great speech.Touching as well.We needed it.
Actress also gets group: Whitaker on Bullock, Sheen flirty on Mirren,Sarsgaard on Mulligan,Oprah on Sidibe,Tucci on capping Streep's noms
And Kate Winslet hands the prize to Bridges. Deserving standing O to go with it! The Dude abides!
Best Actor gets the gangbang treatment. Pfeiffer on Bridges, Farmiga on Clooney, Moore on Firth, Robbins funny on Freeman, Firth on Renner.
The Argentine film beating A Prophet and White Ribbon for best foreign film officially marks this category as nuts.
Editing Oscar for Hurt Locker puts it ahead for Best Picture. This is always a key category. Why no shot of Cameron biting his nails?
Nice to see The Cove win the Oscar for doc. Maybe you'll rent it now. It's so worth your time and is packed with the emotion this show lacks
Is it just me or do Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin seem to be barely registering?
Clooney is enjoying an Oscar show inside his own head that I wish I could see.  Loved his  head bop after the Up in the Air clip.
Avatar wins for visual effects. Duh. Though Bradley Cooper announced it with real surprise.
Up wins for Best Score as it should. But that quick closeup of a blissed out Clooney was a real pick me up.
Isn't the endless dance number to the nominated film scores what this show promised to avoid? I can't find my own pulse. Release the Kraken!
James Taylor sings out the talents we lost this year with great tenderness. But this year's Oscarcast is running low on genuine emotion.
Bullock funny doing cinematography intro. And now Avatar trumps Hurt Locker and the contest is back on.
Nice of Morgan Freeman to explain the difference between sound editing and mixing. Hurt Locker takes down Avatar in both. Sensing a trend.
Twi icons KStew (cough) and Lautner intro tribute to scare flicks. And we needed this clip job why? Plus, scares out of context don't work.
Did you catch the shot of non Jim Cameron fan Kathy Bates when the winning art director called him a genius. Nice camera work.
Supporting Oscar goes to Mo'Nique of course. Her speech,  "It's about the performance not the politics," is righteous but a little cold.
Precious win for adapted screenplay the first shock of the night. It was Up in the Air's one shot at a win. Am I sensing more surprises?
Ben Stiller a vision in Avatar blue. The movie itself could have used some of Stiller's playful tail action. Jim Cameron laughed, politely.
Long intro to short film category. Know what? The 3 categories deserve the attention. But how did Matter of Loaf & Deaf ever lose?
John Hughes tribute fitting and moving. Great to see those actors on stage together. KStew & Lautner look like they never heard of him. Sad.
Downey & Tina Fey actually funny about screenwriting. Rolling Stone writer Mark Boal wins for Hurt Locker. One word: Whoo-hoo!
Why does Miley Cyrus looks so blowzy? She's just a baby. But Song category is for once done painlessly. Weary Kind the only logical choice.
Up wins for animation in a tough category. Yeah, Mr Fox is fantastic. But another good choice.
Waltz wins supporting as he should. "Oscar & Penelope that's an uber Bingo!" Well played and deserved!
All the Oscar talk about Gaby Sidibe maybe pulling a surprise Best Actress win  for Precious is making me hungry for an upset. You?
Bullock gave out free Dvds of All About Steve to all attendees at the Razzie ceremony. Talk about revenge! Hint: they make great frisbees
Kudos to S. Bullock for making good on her promise to show at the Razzies to get her prize as worst actress in All About Steve. Well played,
Transformers 2 takes the Razzie as the year's worst movie and Michael Bay gets worst director. Justice has been done. Razzie, I salute you!
It's Oscar morning so what are we feeling for Best Picture? The box office heat of Avatar or the heart of the underseen Hurt Locker?
I thank the Indie Spirit Awards for the Precious sweep. It was like the Oscars I see in my head though I know it will never happen.

Anyone think the cinematographer's prize to the black and white purity of White Ribbon is the start of a backlash against hi-tech Avatar?
A Prophet wins a bunch of Cesars (the French Oscar). Hear that Academy? You're so stupid about foreign films. Let the right one in this time
When I see a crap movie (Brooklyn's Finest) I now say "Release the Kraken" like Liam Neeson in the Clash of Titans trailer. It helps! Try it
Bridges, Bullock, Waltz & Mo'Nique are Oscar acting favorites. If an upset is possible who'd you like to see score? I'd pick Carey Mulligan
Prepare to be wowed by Mia Wasikowska in Alice in Wonderland. She also killed on HBO's In Treatment. Can't wait to see what she does next.
Congrats to Precious for cleaning up at NAACP with awards for film, director, script, actress & supporting actress. That movie has my heart.

Roman Polanski just named Berlin Film Fest's Best Director for his stellar work on "The Ghost Writer." Throw bouquets or stones accordingly.
Most idiotic charge leveled against Polanski's superb Ghost Writer? It's too "entertaining" to be a great film. Tell that to The Godfather.
Like Shutter Island or not, the charge of red herrings doesn't hold since each scene illuminates a troubled mind.Try keeping your eyes open.
I'm told I'm nuts to admire Shutter Island since it was hated by the NY Times, which liked the drooling Dear John. Scorsese vs Sparks? Hmm.

Sarah Silverman told me she picks Inglourious Basterds for Best Pic Oscar. She's down on Up & forgot Avatar after she saw it. Who agrees?
It's offical: Avatar sinks Titanic as alltime box office champ. What epic really deserves that crown? I'll start bidding with Dark Knight.

Jersey Shore cast hitting Rolling Stone for lunch at 12:30PM. Any questions? The Situation will be ready to answer.
@erspamer_matt Well that just weirded me out!
@diablocody Do you think it helps that the movie practically removed the rape angle from Sebold's book? But you're right, Ronan is that good
On Dr. King's birthday I'm wondering what's up with the biopic Spielberg was planning. Who should star? Denzel, Jamie Foxx, an unkown?
Lovely Bones after a weak start is finding a big audience among teen girls. What's the attraction do you think?
AThought: Since the Golden Dildos proved they exist to award box office, can we change their avatar to a giant $ on a pedestal?
@Zachmandoo I will do it!
@jessbecauseiam Joseph Gordon Levitt deserved that award for sure.
@jorgemps Couldn't agree more. Felt very bad for Carey Mulligan, far more deserving than Bullock!
@BumbleWard It's the Globes, Sasha, and The Soloist didn't make any money.
Hurt Locker totally shut out of the Golden Globes. Congrats for being in classy company.
Avatar, that paragon on indie cinema, wins the big Globe. Nice to know there's an  awards group to help the little guy.
Jeff Bridges is the class act Globe winner of the night for Crazy Heart. Even the Hollywood Foreign Press can get it right. Occasionally.
Ricky Gervais looks so eager for the Globes to be over. So do we all.
Robert Downey jr wins for the appalling but huge box office hit Sherlock Holmes. Lovely how the Globes support the small movies.
Sandra Billock wins for Blind Side and will win the Oscar. Get used to it.
Hangover wins Golden Dildo for comedy. Guess 500 Days of Summer didn't make enough money. Priorites.
Glee wins best Tv show. I'm feeling it.
James Cameron's surprise win for Avatar-come on his ex wife was robbed-results in a gracious acceptance speech to new wife and former.
Scorsese points out the "shared dream" that defines movies past, present and future. He's one of the few still making dreams worth sharing.
De Niro sincere and hilarious in his tribute to Scorsese. DiCaprio justly  appreciative. A rare tribute that actually feels heartfelt.
Jane Lynch does NOT win the Golden Globe for Glee. I officially think the Hollywood Foreign Press are idiots.
Finally Drew Barrymore wins for Grey Gardens. Costar Jessica Lange got the Emmy DB deserved. Her best performance ever!
Any reason T Bone Streep doesn't mention Amy Adams by name in her acceptance speeches. After all She is Julie to her Julia.
Really liked Grey Gardens but the laundry list of names read by the winning producers is why people hate award shows.
Globe wins for Julianna Maguiles and Michael C. Hall. Finally some sense.
Gervais says, "A Golden Globe cannot be bought, officially." I love it.
Beatle Paul's line about animation a good one. "it's also for adults who take drugs."
Globe show same old stuff, but the scary shot of William Hurt in that beard woke me up.
@gurghi Point taken.
Golden Globe Stupidity #4: nominating Tobey Maguire for overacting in Brothers & ignoring Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner & Moon's Sam Rockwell.
Golden Globe Stupidity #3: Last Station lead Christopher Plummer gets a supporting nod at the expense of In the Loop's superb Peter Capaldi
Golden Globe Stupidity #2: Julia Roberts nominated for the misfired Duplicity is a damned insult to Zooey Deschanel in 500 Days of Summer.
Golden Globe Stupidity# 1: Nominating It's Complicated for screenplay over Serious Man, An Education,Precious,500 Days of Summer & Messenger
Sandra Bullock's near certain Globe win tonite shouldn't blindside anyone. Her role makes Sarah Palin voters all warm inside.
Globes are better with TV than fartbag Emmys. Newbies Glee, Nurse Jackie Falco, Good Wife Margulies & the great Jane Lynch could even win.
If Hurt Locker beats Avatar for the Golden Globe tonite, the little movie that could will be sitting pretty in the Oscar race.
@AwardsDaily I understand the theory, Sasha. But it still bothers me.Carey and An Education deserve way more love.
@mattwarren well said, my friend. It's why award shows are becoming increasingly irrelevant.
Hurt Locker wins the big prize. Avatar gets action award. Hangover  comedy. Basterds & Up in the Air for writing. All bases covered. Blah.
And may I add that Carey Mulligan was robbed.
The Streep-Bullock actress tie is a copout. But Bullock's funny, touching acceptance speech just made her the Oscar favorite IMHO.
Loved best actor winner Jeff Bridges for thanking the critics for rewarding him after years of press junket roundtables. Tit for tat, Dude.
Critics award to Kathryn Bigelow as Best Director is so satisfying bec it is so deserved. Nice to see her ex Jim Cameron leading the cheers
Why would the  broadcast critics  dilute the meaning of awards by jamming in so many categories (action, comedy,etc) that they lose meaning?
Critics Choice awards must put Kristin Chenowith out of her misery. Such awful writing and strained humor.
Here's hoping the Broadcast critics won't go all Golden Globes box office ass kissing on their VH1 awards tonight. Avatar isn't everything.
Times Sq billboard of Mel Gibson's new movie. Seeing next week. What vibe are you getting? http://twitpic.com/y8iko
@DANNY_DICKBLOOD Wasn't me, Danny. To really crap on the good Hurt Locker folks, I'd have seated them with the cast of Jersey Shore.
@MrEuclid you know, Will, I think we saw 2 different movies.

Kill Me Now! Taylor Lautner will sit at the Hurt Locker table at Sunday's Golden Globes. Why? Says GG's prez, "to make the table glamorous."
Congrats to Conan for showing something I don't see a lot in pop culture today: backbone.
@MrEuclid I do. Up in the Air is a serious comedy that gets at something Americans don't even know we've lost: our sense of shame.
@MrEuclid Will, what happened to staying positive?
Tobey Maguire dumped from go-young Spider-man prequel. It's art not commerce, studio says. No word yet if Peter Parker will be a vampire.
Screw Writer's Guild noms since they dropped films from scribes who aren't members:  No Basterds, D9, Up, In the Loop, An Education. WTF?
Re Hurt Locker DVD: Go Blu-ray. See why Jeremy Renner deserves the acting nod the dumb Golden Globes gave to ex-Spider-man Tobey Maguire.
DVD Must: Bigelow's Hurt Locker. A paltry $13 million box office means you need to catch up and see what Oscar will soon be shouting about.
I leave you tonite with thoughts of critic turned filmmaker Eric Rohmer, dead at 89. He put the art in cinematic conversation. Bless him.
@AwardsDaily Tennessee Williams would spin in his grave if Madonna played Blanche. I'd vote for Kate Winslet as the new movie Blanche.
@AwardsDaily Funny how the very British Leigh won her 2 deserved Oscars for playing Southern belles in Streetcar and Gone with the Wind.
@chameleoncloud Fassbender was also at tonite's NY critics party to celebrate Hunger. Did you see him in Fish Tank? He's got a big future.
@AwardsDaily If they remade Streetcar who'd you cast as Blanche? Just saw the great Cate do her on  stage. But the movies need ... what?
@chameleoncloud We had a fun chat. I joked about him going Hollywood doing Green Hornet. Waltz said he hasn't met any sleazebags yet. Wait.
Clooney introduced me to his new girlfriend Elisabetta tonite. An Italian beauty with charm to rival George's.
Kathryn qBigelow looks good with a directing award in her hand. The first of many I think and richly deserved. Listen up, Oscar.
Standing O for great film critic Andrew Sarris, 81, a moving tribute from NY Critics. Ditto words from former student Kathryn Bigelow.
George Clooney is the wicked life of the NY Film Critics party tonite at Crimson. Jabs Rex Reed for reviews that always say, "Clooney sucks"
@hy_steria Julia, thank god!
NY Film Critics party tonite: an informal chance to see Clooney, Streep, Waltz & Bigelow in same room before they become award-show staples.
2 Masters: Scorsese's Shutter Island & Polanski's Ghost Writer will both open on Feb. 19. Who says the start of the year is only for hacks?

@JasonReitman I'm honored to be part of one footloose director's attempt to be interviewed by everyone!  Lars von Trier, eat your heart out
@opica I'm with you on that one.
@yvetteava I thought yes, and he did it. Happy news.
@sexbiscuit Dafoe says the Green Goblin would kick the ass of his vampire slayer in Daybreakers. Love the question.
For  those who thought I was wrong to predict the DGA  would nominate Lee Daniels over Eastwood (Invictus), I say don't rule out Precious.
Directors Guild got it right with Bigelow (Hurt Locker), Cameron (Avatar), Reitman (Up in the Air), Daniels (Precious) & QT (Basterds).
http://twitpic.com/x22c5 - From the way Willem Dafoe holds a guitar in my Rolling Stone office, can he play it or not?
Willem Dafoe's role in Shadow of the Vampire makes him the only actor to be Oscar nominated for playing a vamp. Who else would you pick?
People's Choice awards: New Moon best movie, Taylor Lautner & Miley Cyrus breakout actors. So the people are all 13-year-old girls, right?
Willem Dafoe Trivia Question: he starred in 2 films that won the Best Picture Oscar. Can you name both off the top of your head?
@AwardsDaily DGA picks: Bigelow, Cameron, Reitman, Daniels, Tarantino.
Willem Dafoe, vampire slayer in Daybreakers, in my Rolling Stone office this am for Off the Cuff interview. Good starter questions anyone?
@donrlewis22 hey, I'm doing my best.
1 of the best '09 movies you never heard of hits DVD today,Robert Siegel's Big Fan with a terrific Patton Oswalt as a NY Giants obsessive
Happy Producers' nodded to small stuff (Precious, Hurt Locker, An Education, Up in the Air). But why shaft Messenger, 500 Days & the Coens?
Producers Guild noms for Best Movie this AM inc 3 sci-fi (Avatar, District 9, Star Trek). If that's a hint of what Oscar will do OK by me.
@smokebluntz Gotta agree.
@camsontheradio I do like Schneider. But Woody Harrelson is the only 09 supporting actor that deserves to be up there with Waltz.
@SheilsBabe Well said and with the proper enthusiasm.

@JasonReitman Congrats on the fresh kill. What's on the movie bill at Chez Reitman this first weekend of 2010?
@ropeofsilicon Done!
1. Up: A funny, touching and vital portrait of a marriage in four minutes of Pixar magic. Genius is an overused word. Not here.
2. Precious: The scene with social worker Mariah Carey when mother (Mo'Nique) and abused child (Gaby Sidibe) finally understand each other.
3. Up in the Air: The hard realization, reflected on George Clooney's face, when he learns that traveling light may not be the answer.
4. The Hurt Locker: Soldier Jeremy Renner afraid and lost, not in the act of defusing a bomb in Iraq, but alone at home in a supermarket.
Where the Wild Things Are: "I want to eat you up, I love you so." A moment that captures the terror and beauty of childhood.
6. Inglourious Basterds: Tarantino topping himself at shattering our nerves in the opening scene with the Nazi and the French farmer.
7. Crazy Heart: Jeff Bridges taking on Bear, the sound man out to ambush his stage act. It's the outline of a life in one telling moment.
8. A Serious Man: The phone call in the final scene that might be the biggest cosmic joke that the brothers Coen have ever pulled.
9. 500 Days of Summer: Joseph Gordon Levitt's dance thru the streets to the bounciest Hall & Oates the morning after he & Summer make love.
10. Avatar: the moment of true emotional dimension when Jake Sully and his blue avatar lie side by side in a blending of mind and heart.
Happy 2010 Twitterverse pals. As promised, I'll start out the new year by remembering my top 10 movie moments from 2009. Love to hear yours.
http://twitpic.com/w3bc1 - Best 09 use of movie poster. Name the movie & the poster?
http://twitpic.com/w28v8 - Nightclub scene with best actress of 09. Can you name?
Best putdown comes in Star Trek when Zachary Quinto's young Spock speaks the words, "Live long and prosper," as a massive fu to Vulcan sbobs
Best hetero screen chemistry of 09: George Clooney & Vera Farmiga turning themselves on by comparing elite status symbols in Up in the Air.
No one's seeing the musical Nine, so you're missing a Penelope Cruz strip that singes the screen. That'll teach you to listen to critics.
Sacha Baron Cohen's Br√ºno used a "God Hates Fags" protest march and a  specialist in scaring gays straight to bite hypocrisy's ass. Bravo.
Wow shootout? Clive Owen blowing holes in NYC's Guggenheim Museum in a bullet ballet that made a decent film, The International,  dazzling.
Notorious was unloved, but newbie Jamal Woolard got Biggie's flow down rapping the "uh" in the "it's all good, baby, bay-bee, uh" on Juicy.
An indelibe face? Marion Cotillard in Public Enemies being told in jail that her lover's dying words were, "Tell Billie, bye bye blackbird"
Indelibe verbal moment from the films of '09: In the Loop's Peter Capaldi turning swearing into an art form. "Lubricated horse cock," indeed
#10yearsago I overrated American Beauty when Fight Club, Magnolia, Election, The Limey & Being John Malkovich better stood the test of time.
@DANNY_DICKBLOOD Glad to help you fill the void, Danny boy.
Even the brutal reviews of Lovely Bones can't deny the terrible beauty of young Saoirse Ronan when her spirit flees her body's rape & murder
Hard to forget Michael Moore in Capitalism: A Love Story putting up crime scene tape around Wall Street. Talk about laugh till it hurts!
Funniest 09 movie cameo?  That guy from Tootsie (don't want to spoil the surprise for DVD watchers) who adds comic dynamite to Zombieland.
Indelible 09 movie moment from This Is It. When Michael Jackson busts his 1st move on "Wanna Be Startin Something." Pop poetry in motion.
@msnyder01 No worrez. Wait for New Year's day when I countdown the Top 10 indelible movie moments.
@mrRuimy Well, IG is #11 on my list. It was the silly Brad Pitt stuff that hurt it a little. The rest is aces.
@truthaboutmusic Maybe. But no 2 films were more cynically conceived and made with more contempt for their audience. That = time capsule bad
Indelible 09 Film Moment: a blissfully juiced Nic Cage winking at an iguana no one else can see in Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.

@yvetteava You are not alone, Yvette. Avatar fever is in the air. It's damn near the only thing people ask me about.
@AwardsDaily I'd love to hear your reaction to a 2nd Avatar visit.
@TheFunnyJosh You're serious about your Avatar grudge, Josh? Let me just say that what Cameron achieves amply compensates for his screwups.
@bpdreview I like your enthusiasm, Brian. Police Adjective is a real Love/Hate thing. My favorite kind of film.
@ReelTalker Not so with Snatch, Candice. One of Brad Pitt's best.
Taking a 2nd look at these Foreign Film screeners. Which intrigue you, which don't? http://twitpic.com/vgvax
Now that most of you have seen Sherlock, do you agree or not that Downey's fine acting is buried in the junkyard of Guy Ritchie's directing?
@imscottmurphy Amen to that, Scott. Could a movie get a better compliment from a modern audience?
@akstanwyck Good one. Have you seen Avatar in 2D to make a comparison?
Btw: My top 3D moment in Avatar is Jake Sully's taming of the banshee and their takoff into splendiforous flight. What's yours?
Why is Avatar 3D a hit? Shot this last nite. Audience actually stopped stuffing its  face during the banshee scene. http://twitpic.com/vcc0n
@iamBenLyons Absolutely!
Best one line review of 09 is the indefatigable Roger Ebert @ebertchicago citing Up in the Air as "Death of a Salesman starring Cary Grant"
Robin Wood died 12/18. Read him on Marnie in Hitchcock's Films, resee the film&learn what great film criticism is. http://twitpic.com/vbisl

@benmshields I think UP will be only the 2nd animated movie to get a Best Picture nomination. So far Beauty & the Beast is the one & only.

@EDouglasWW The thing is Ed, I don't see blue people generating the same repeat biz as Leo and Kate- in any decade.
Snow blamed for Avatar failure to break box office records debut weekend. With Cameron it's always slow and steady wins the race. Just wait.
Jeff Bridges tried to teach me guitar on my Popcorn show. His only known failure. http://twitpic.com/ue472
Glad to rewatch all 4 Academy screeners (Precious, Crazy Heart, Nine, Orson Welles) but gave Jeff Bridges first dib. Truly great acting.
Snowed with these Oscar screeners. Which would you watch 1st? Never? http://twitpic.com/uckwl
@jillinsk Avatar is the one 3D film I've seen that feels organic and not self conscious. Go for it, Jill. Let me know how you feel.
@Bandini1 Not terrible. Just a bit like going to the opera with ear plugs.
@benmshields Like your shoutout to Sigourney! She gives Avatar as classy, witty human touch.
@AlanMattli My point exactly!

@McHenryFilmBuff Couldn't disagree more!
SAG Smarts: Appreciation  for An Education as one of the year's best. The Golden dickwads couldn't find room for it. Not enuf big names!
SAG Stupidity:  No nod to Glee's Jane Lynch. WTF? You guys are supposed to be actors. You're supposed to know comic brilliance. Shame!
SAG Puzzler: Diane Kruger gets the acting nod for Inglourious Basterds instead of Melanie Laurent who gave the film its bruised heart? What?
SAG again: Not to beat a dead horse. But Bullock's actress nod for Blind Side is just another step toward her Oscar. Laff now, cry later!
SAG Shocker: The best cast award that usually translates into best movie ignored Up in the Air. And for what? The hit-and-miss Nine! Sheesh
SAG nominees included solid choice of Jeremy Renner in Hurt Locker. The Golden Dildoes suck up to big names to get ratings for their TV show
@bdkreviews Gladiator, Chicago, Driving Miss D,  other best film victors did not win Oscars for their directors. Way to spread gold around.
@bdkreviews My guess is Up in the Air for Picture. Bigelow for director.
@TSpagnola When haven't the Golden Globes left a bad taste?
@ryanlavia Bullock is the Sarah Palin of this year's Oscars. Her enemies make her supporters more determined. You can't buy that kinda heat.
@ReelTalker No one's counting on it, which makes it kind of irresistible.
@AlanMoote And that's bad why?  Many great films keep the dream open and let us dream the rest. Lynch is a poet of cinema like Almodovar.
@bdkreviews Amen to that brother! Mulligan deserves it. But I'm talking Oscars and Bullock, the populist choice, is good for business!
@JasonReitman  Bacon before steak-  a high for the arteries! As DDL sings in Nine,"What's a good thing for if not for taking it to excess"?
Just talked to Hugh Grant about the comedy actors he admires. He used the word "genius" for Sandler, Rogen, Rudd & especially Michael Cera.
Some folks are shocked Sandra Bullock got a Globe nod for Blind Side. Wake up! If there's a surpise win at the Oscars it'll be Bullock.
One thing the Globes get right is TV with nods to fresh shows like Modern  Family and Glee with the must-win Jane Lynch. Listen up, Emmy!
What do the Golden Globes have against Zooey Deschanel? They nod to the movie and Joe G-L but skip her for Julia Roberts in Duplicity. WTF!
@JasonReitman Verdict, please.
@KarinaLongworth Fair enuf, Karina. It's a sharp funny movie. But the dialogue is mostly improv.
@akstanwyck That's exactly what I'm feeling.
Another close NY Critics vote was Clooney over Jeff Bridges. I think they'll go neck and neck down the Oscar wire. What horse r u backing?
NY Film Critics voting ended in a squeaker win for In the Loop as best screenplay over Up in the Air. Up haa the strionger structure, no?
@JasonReitman Ouch. But at least Boston is showing great taste in movies.
Congrats to LA film critics for naming Jeff Bridges best actor for Crazy Heart. The Dude abides.
Prepping for NY Film Critics voting Monday AM. LA crix picked Hurt Locker. What movie will get the most love from us Big Apple types?

Just saw the next to last 2009 film I need to do a 10 Best list. Despite 2 fireball actors, it's not making it. One  more to go: Avatar.
@BumbleWard Keep on keeping on with the "Education" love, Bumble. It needs it.
@JasonReitman You never saw The Apartment? Really? Really!!!!
@EDouglasWW Me 2 but history differs.  Think snubs to Giamatti (Sideways), Sally Hawkins, Scott-Thomas, etc. Bullock has the glam factor.
@paulajordan07 Would love Depp and Stuhlbarg to happen but think other 3 spots will go to Day Lewis, Colin Firth and Mandela Freeman.
@EDouglasWW What exactly does the industry have against Bullock? Isn't she good for business? Isn't that a top priority?
@paulajordan07 I think the Best Actor race with be a photo finish between George Clooney (Up in the  Air) and Jeff Bridges (Crazy Heart)
@AwardsDaily What about Alec Baldwin? Does It's Complicated make him a lock for Best Supporting Actor?
Looking forward to seeing James Spader make his Bdwy debut in David Mamet's "Race." Let's hear arguments on what is Spader's best film perf.
@hy_steria Mirren for bring brilliant, sexy and rowdy as Tolstoy's wife in the upcoming "Last Station." Dame Helen is in peak form here.
@mensanthemovies I have total love for Cornish in.Bright Star. She dwarves the Oscar nomination Bullock wil probably get for Blind Side.
@harlancoben Everyone's a critic!
@hitRECordJoe Amen to that brother
@AwardsDaily Sasha, what-no love for Carey Mulligan? And now that you've seen It's Complicated, is it Streep for that or Julie & Julia?
@chipinny No way is she better than the other 4.  I'm sayin the movie is striking a chord and Bullock will be its Oscar  standard bearer.
Now that Nic Cage's Bad Lieutenant is slumping, this photo suggests Cage may regret taking on Keitel's role.  http://twitpic.com/rd5sl
As "Blind Side" continues to cash in, look for Sandra Bullock to join Streep, Sidibe, Mulligan and Mirren in the Best Actress Oscar race.
Is "Blind Side" killing at the box office because America wants to see a  Republican woman kicking ass? I'll take Bullock over Palin anyday
Fab lunch: leftover Thanksgiving turkey with stuffing smeared with cranberry on toasted sourdough! Should I add avocado or it go at that?
Took a 2nd look at "An Education" last nite at a packed Cape Cod movie house. Liked it even more. Carey Mulligan should be Oscar's darling.
Who thinks "Lives of Others" deserves inclusion among the decade's 10 Best?
Stormy Cape Cod morn this Thanksgiving weekend. Shake me up to finish list of decade's best movies. http://twitpic.com/ravye
To keep your movie Thanksgiving happy avoid the witless persistence of Old Dogs. Or maybe you have your own contender for prize turkey?
Also caught Curb Your Enthusiasm finale from Sunday. The last scene with Larry and Cheryl had just the right blend of romance and neurosis.
Got 3 more 2009 movies to see before I can do my 10 Best list.I have a feeling the best isn't yet to come.
Just caught Joseph Gordon Levitt's SNL stint from Sat. His Make Em Laff opener from Singin in the Rain was killer. Write this guy a musical
Can't write about it yet but just saw one of the big year-end movies and it left me cold.  Happens every year with the last-minute stuff.

Just saw Jeff Bridges give a performance as a broken country star in Crazy Heart that should have Oscar heat.  Is the Dude the best or what?
@At today's interview Crispin Glover expressed special fondness for River's Edge. I totally agree.
@walkingtaco I think I know but I'll ask him anyway.
Crispin Glover at RS this PM for Off the Cuff talk. What's on your mind about Crispy? And what role of his can't you get out of your head ?
Here's Viggo with pin. http://twitpic.com/pv4nr
Viggo says The Road means as much to him as any he's made. But he wore a pin from a film he did this decade that I love. Can you guess?
@Bottlerocket Good question. More Strider I think.
Viggo says his son Henry is a film scholar. Want Henry for a duel review of The Road on my podcast. He sees Road 2nite.  Hope Henry says yes
Viggo really kicked in interview. He's still pissed that Cronenberg has never even been nominated for an Oscar. Me 2.

Woody Harrelson's RS visit was killer. When I asked which of his films he'd like to bury, he chose Money Train & The Walker.  Arguments?
Had breakfast today with "Hurt Locker" screenwriter Mark Boal. We talked great war movies. His pick. "Battle of Algiers." What's yours?
@thekingbulletin The Precious backlash is just absurd and yes it will do very well at the Oscars. Great movies always stir things up.
@taylorrae Streep's only 2 Oscar wins were for those movies. Isn't it about time for a 3rd? Maybe Julia Child will cook one up for her.
@BeBesaysmwah xx back atcha for even remembering She Devil ever existed. And where is Rosanne these days?
@Rbrentl88 Close but no cigar, I'm afraid.
@ScottFeinberg Thanks for the shoutout, Scott. And congrats on a piece that's indispensable for the Twitterverse.
Streep laughed when I noted her 1st screen kiss with Clooney was done with fox puppets: "it's probably the only way it's gonna happen." Ah.
Backstage Wes Anderson told Meryl Streep he particularly admired her performance in Postcards from the Edge. What's your favorite Streep?
Just bk fr Apple store in Soho. Moderated a lively Fantastic Mr Fox q&a with Wes Anderson, Meryl Streep &Jason Schwartzman. All in top form.
Stephen King's 1000 page "Under the Dome" just out.  Got me thinking of my fave King on page (The Shining) and film (Carrie). Your thoughts?
Props to Jason Reitman (Up in the Air) & Duncan Jones (Moon) for vigorously promoting their films around the globe and with smarts and flair
@jbstrevel I have indeed J.B. and I'm sticking with "Mad Men" as the best. Good stuff happening though on "Burn This."
Don't buy the negative "Avatar" buzz. Cameron knows 3D & IMAX can save the movies. If he half pulls it off, box office & Oscar will respond.

@JasonReitman OK, I'll bite. Why so strange?
@frankenteen And when you're back in the Big Apple, give a call and we'll do the RS cover wall.
Good News: Precious, reportedly 2 grim to score big bucks, opened to $1.8 million in 18 locations for a record-breaking $100,000 per screen
Spending today watching advance DVDs to pick top wowsers for  next issue of RS. So far Star Trek kills it for looks & sound + great extras.
Took my own advice and saw "This Is It" a 2nd time. Kid with his dad got up and danced during Beat It. That's what I call a true MJ tribute.
Thanks to all who linked me to Streisand singing "Gentle Rain" but I want to find the 1966 movie of same name that the song came from.
@rollingstone90 Thanks for the heads up on this one. Loved it.
Woke up to radio playing Streisand's melting take on "Gentle Rain," a bossa nova from a 1960's movie I can't find anywhere. Can you help?
"New Moon: The Twilight Sag"a opens in 2 weeks. Who's pumped? And who's content to stay home with "Vampire Diaries" and "True Blood" on DVD?
Note to non-fans of Michael Jackson: Don't pass up "This Is It". Seeing him on stage and vulnerable may just open your eyes to his artistry
The performance-capture Xmas Carol hollows me out with tricked-up 3D and dead-eyes. Would've loved seeing Jim Carrey play Scrooge for real.

Ricky Gervais to host Golden Dildos, er Globes, on Jan. 17. Wise decision, since this cutting-edge Brit is congenitally unable to kiss ass.

@anotherMJ Sure it can, Matt. What galls me is that "Adam" wants credit for going deeper without actually doing it.
@slevvers Those count too, Bradley.
@theworldofdeuce It's that Copley is Oscar caliber but won't get nominated that makes the process so D-mented.
@RaquelCepeda He probably does, Raquel, which is why the Oscar system is so broken.
@theworldofdeuce Your point being?I did see IB and don't see who's being underrated. No way is it certain Oscar nominee Christoph Waltz.
Most overrated actor this summer is Hugh Dancy in Adam. Putting a pretty face on Asperger's does not advance understanding of that syndrome.

@iamBenLyons I've got at least 5 recent candidates. Give me a hint.
D9 is No1 at box office with $37 million. GI Joe falls 60%. There is some justice.
@harlancoben Ok I'll bite. What's Numero UNO on your top 5?
@harlancoben Very nice. Asked Mary Clark to pick her fave Hitchcock film in honor of the master's 110 b'day. What's yours, mystery man?
@Kajll Seeing Vertigo made me want to write about film-my personal Hitchcock pick. As for D9, see it now! It kills the bad taste of Trans2.
@twinlorna Paradine Case never gets any love. Hitchcock wanted Robert Newton for the Louis Jordan part. But PC is tasty. Thanks for reminder
@hitRECordJoe Did you ever see the 1967 short Cours du Soir where Tati teaches comedy to actors? Joe, you have to see it.
Had dinner on Cape last night  with Queen  of mystery bestsellers Mary Higgins Clark. She says Rececca is her Hitchcock fave. What's yours?
Back on Cape Cod for weekend.Will still find time to watch a Hitchcock classic. The suspense master's 110th birthday was Thursday.
@hitRECordJoe Which Tati gem are you polishing?
@tomsgal You mean with my theme song? Don't know but Tom sounds mucho busy. Totally understand.
@RHCPfan24 Actually the pup is a Shetland sheep dog named Ethan. And even when the movies go dim he's a constant light. Love that critter!

@craigary  Ponyo, from Japanese anime master Miyazaki, should definitely join D9 on your must list‚Äîif you can find it.
Interviewing that inglourious basterd Quentin Tarantino in three hours for my ABC show. Anything you've got to know?  Let it rip.
What's the weekend movie must? Are you kidding! District 9 is the first and only choice. Miss it, and the aliens deserve to get you.
Guys: If you agree to see the sappy Time Traveler's Wife with a date, it must be love. Why else dive into this tank of molten marshmallow?
@tguard imho Harry Potter is fantasy not sci-fi so it doesn't fit the category.
@TheFlickcast I agree District 9 is good but  it didn't cost $100 million and it's not about  toys, videos or comics. So I didn't include.

@MatthewFrazier I spoke to Blomkamp and Peter Jackson and they both said HALO aint happening.
@jlynnefennell Maybe I need to have what you're having!
@NoBillo Agree. Peter Capaldi as Malcolm is the comic antiChrist of In the Loop. Never has an actor cursed his way so deeply into my heart.
Since you asked: The no-food rule at critic screenings stems frm the distraction (imagine missing a sec of Trans2 ) and cleaning up the mess
I'm starting a poll: What's the best movie snack besides popcorn? I sneak in Sour Skittles. Do you know food is banned at critic screenings?
Didn't go to Comic-Con but did see District 9, the aliens in Jo-burg knockout produced on the cheap by Peter Jackson. OMFG, start with wow.
Movie audiences are lining up for The Ugly Truth. Stop it, people. Everything about this romcom totally sucks.

Emmy did good nominating Drew Barrymore (Grey Gardens), Gabriel Byrne (In Treatment) & muthalover Justin Timberlake (SNL). 3 great TV spots.
@joanna_louise Thanks so much Joanna for making me smile.
@conchamoreno I think Reygades makes films of incomparable beauty.He is a magician with light.
@16yrolddirector  Rogen said Entourage wasn't very funny. So Sunday's show jokes that no sane woman would have sex with him. Fair payback?
@inro Funny. I always think the same thing about people who visit Manhattan in the melting humidity of summer.
@6Mman I'll be putting on my Sunday clothes to collect, Andrew. What kind of lobster are you eating up north in California?
@tomsgal Tom says he's on his way,
@6Mman Are you on Matt Cooley's payroll? I saw the lobsters in the kitchen going right in the pot. Send me that fiver!
@rocknrollwife Finally, someone not giving Matt Cooley any love! rock on!
http://twitpic.com/ascq2 - Me and best lobster roll on Cape Cod
On Cape Cod for weekend. My pal Matt Cooley says you can't get a good lobster roll in Massachusetts. He claims Maine is the best. Arguments?
@TomFelton And while you're jamming keep thinking "Off the Cuff" and how eager Pete Travers and all Rolling Stone is for that theme song.
Feud time: Watch Entourage Sunday and see Seth Rogen gets dissed. Kevin Connolly says the attack was provoked by something snide Rogen said.
@ghetto_journo My guess is that Emmy slugs will wake up to True Blood next year. They are always skittish about new shows,except Mad Men.
Emmy Stupidity #3: With all the love for Mad Men, nothing for January Jones who got so deep into the neglected wife they breathed together.
Emmy Stupidity #2: Heroes isn't what it was first season. But  Zachary Quinto (Star Trek) just nails his villain role and deserved a nod.
Emmy Stupidity #1: No nomination for Anna Paquin who just lights up HBO's smart and sexy True Blood (also ignored in the series category)
@Magialuna Clare, nice job getting on the Tom Felton bandwagon. He and Alan Rickman put talent and tortured soul into the new Harry Potter.
@joshuavalin Whatevver Works is only for Woody completists. As for the rest, go for it.
@jaykeith I asked and Grenier and Connolly just laughed and laughed. Draw your own conclusions.
@emmeloowhoo Paquin says she's never seen or read Twilight. Seems that True Blood Tv creator Alan Ball didn't want his cast to be influenced
@markdubec Thanks for the shoutout. Nice to hear from a fellow film junkie. Happy that you share my enthusiasm for 500 Days of Zooey.
@spaceyfan Anna says she does slip on the accent. Just does the scene again. On my show I loved it when she slipped into the Sookie voice.
@parkmohler I pressed Anna paquin repeatedly on Margaret. It was the only time in the interview she shut down. Now I'm really intrigued.

@tenlux I say yes but you have to mark on a curve.
@troylsmith yoi're right, the Spanish accents were horrible. Whole movie would play better with the sound off.
Rob Pattinson resembles Idol contender Adam Lambert in first scene as Dali in "Little Ashes", a movie getting trashed more than it deserves.
@hippeesooz The logical side that knows Star Trek movies don't make big money in the US and fizzle around the rest of the globe.
Can Star Trek hit a $100 mill opening and break records?  The Vulcan in me says it's illogical. But the human in me is hot to see it happen.
@hippeesooz Love that answer!

@mjgprod "The Room" seems to be a L.A. midnight movie phenom. I'm stuck in NYC with no access.
Can't say I'm sad at Wolverine bonanza. Hugh Jackman rises above the mess. But $15 million for Ghosts of McConaugheys Past? That's tragic!
@sistermedia Just show you know: Depp's great-grandmother was Cherokee. So the casting isn't that off the ethnic bar.
@KevinSpacey You were so right about Norman Conquests. Teriffic in all departments, Good luck on Tony Tuesday.
@mjgprod I know! Obsessed is just 2 PG13 careful.  Showgirls is recklessly bad. That's why it's so good!
Johnny Depp is in line to play Tonto in the big-screen "Lone Ranger." But who's the Masked Man? I vote Josh Brolin. Who'd you pick?
@mjgprod Can't wait to hear your reaction.
@katriord Gracias mucho. . Loved hearing Nimoy's explanation. But I still can't do it. Damn!
Depressed that limp-dick Wolverine kicks off the movie summer? Wait till next weekend when the new "Star Trek" does it right. Really right.
Am I alone thinking Carla Gugino (Entourage) should be a megastar.  Just saw her on stage in "Desire Under the Elms." Two words: Tony Award.
"Wolverine" opening weekend is pegged at $70 million and up! Can it top Iron Man's debut at $102 million last summer? Doesn't deserve to.
Bad Movie Friday: There's always one. Today it's "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" with McConaughey trashing his career as an oversexed Scrooge.

Obsession 6: Apologies for calling Beyonce's non-thriller by the wrong name. It's "Obsessed." And it's awful.
@LaurenMoreau I expected it to be fun bad,  like "Uninvited."  But "Obsession" was just a dud. It bored me breathless.
Obsession 5: Scary thought. This brain snatcher will be No. 1 at the box office this weekend.  I know it. Fight back, people, stay home.
Obsessed 4: Movie over. Hell to sit thru. Beyonce sings over credits. Only good thing to say.  Back to office to review. It won't be pretty.
Obsessed 3: No movie yet-just crap ads (we pay for this!) and crap trailers (Gift 2, please),about a dozen. They outnumber customers.Damn!
Obsessed 2: Bought ticket for 11am show. Usher says it's 2 beautiful out for movies. "Any movie or just this one" I ask. Think I scared her.

Monday box office reports obvious win for "Monsters vs Aliens." Too bad that the 3D and Seth Rogen are the only good things about it.
Just out of LaBute's Reasons to be Pretty. Best play on Broadway rite now. Best look at how we screw each other up in relationships.
I'm introing LaBute's first movie, 1997's "In the Company of Men" on Thurs at Museum of Modern Art. Wonder if he's mellowed? Hope not!
On my way to 3pm matin√©e of Neil Le Bute's "reasons to be pretty." It's his first play to hit Broadway. I'm expecting fireworks!
Cobin  worries that Hollywood will screw up the US redo. He's probably right. The French did great with Tell No One, out Tues on DVD Get it!
Just met ace mystery writer Harlen Coben at brunch. All over him with questions about "Tell No One," his book the French made into fab movie
Carnage reminds me of weird Mickey D "give me that fish" TV spot. Who else Is freaked by that singin fish? it's scarier than Haunting in CT
Props to that usherI did enjoy the carnage and the chaos. God of Carnage is the best twisted fun on Broadway. Gandolfini a natural on stage
Usher says the same thing to everyone. Of course we're here for God of Carnage! What else? He keeps repeating it. Nuts! Now I'm saying it
About to see Jamea Gandolfini in Broadway play. Usher asks "You here for God of Carnage? Then adds,"Enjoy the carnage and the chaos." Whaat!
I told Rogen if kids saw his twisted mall cop in Observe & Report expecting Paul Blart, they'd freak and cry,he said "Good I hate kids."
Rogen and I stand near a poster of him as BOB the blob in Monsters cd Aliens. He says they have similar genitals. Actually points to them.
Seth Rogen says he will play media boss Britt Reid, the Hornet's alter ego,as a douchebag. He says he'll base the character on himself.
Meet with Rogen. Flab gone to play Green Hornet this summer. Says he lost it thru diet and a killer trainer. Bummer. I wanted a magic potion
Horror finally over. Will file review later. Cabbing it to ABC to interview Seth Rogen for my Popcorn show. Want to ask about Green Hornet.
Film breaks. Most exciting thing to happen so far in a movie that uses every cheap haunted house trick. Audience still screams. Go figure.
Tons of trailers. "Crank 2" does not look good. Movie starts with Based on The True Story. Sure signs it's bogus.
Two more ticket buyers come in. One asked the usher if this is "Miss March.' Oddly she says YES!
Counted 14 paying customers in a huge theater. They are scarily quiet waiting to be haunted!
Studio won't show me Haunting in Connecticut. Making supreme sacrifice and buying a ticket for 3pm show on 42nd St.
