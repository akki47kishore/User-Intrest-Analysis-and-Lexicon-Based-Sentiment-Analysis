@LeeMall83 @MrRighTNoW_818 @KayDMusiQ There are no red flags and this is unlike any other Marvel movie. This is a Star Wars-level film for Disney in every way - and one of their biggest movies ever for that matter - and they are treating it as such. It‚Äôs that simple.
From what I am hearing -- and to answer a bunch of similar responses -- this late embargo has nothing at all to do with concerns about the movie and everything to do with concerns about major reveals and plot twists. This is exactly how Disney treats its STAR WARS movies, btw

@NikkiNovak @Fandango @readyplayerone @wbpictures That said, I do think Spielberg approached RPO from a very audience-first perspective
@NikkiNovak @Fandango @readyplayerone @wbpictures Well, I think all directors have the audience in mind when they're creating a movie -- I think Rian was more responding to the reaction after the fact. If that influences him at all moving forward in terms of working on more Star Wars movies.
Also: Considering @BacktotheFuture is one of the most referenced films in #ReadyPlayerOne, I asked Spielberg to reflect on that film and what it means to him. (Also, what it was like to direct the DeLorean...)

@DestinyDreadful @KevinMcCarthyTV @RottenTomatoes I think if it wins, it'll win for Best Adapted Screenplay. I am currently picking MUDBOUND to take that category, but I think it's between those two

@KevinMcCarthyTV @RottenTomatoes They are both very different movies, but I feel like a win for GET OUT means more and says more, and it's the more popular choice, period.
@KevinMcCarthyTV @RottenTomatoes Yeah right now I am leaning towards Get Out winning Pic and Del Toro winning Director. I think all these new Academy members are shaking things up, and you can't just rely on historical stats anymore. Get Out has the momentum, I think

#BlackPanther
@THATJacqueline @rejects @marcbernardin @ValerieComplex @JoelleMonique @SabinaHasNoR What is this game - is it a movie I like or a movie poster I like?
@midasretouch06 @Marvel I got no skin in this game -- I agree Marvel puts out great content. I'm a big fan of their movies. I just think it's a fun box office story to follow
Also IMAX will be a bigger factor as #InfinityWar was shot entirely with IMAX cameras. Curious to see how they lean into that as we approach its release
I think the key to what should shape up to be a fun battle between INFINITY WAR &amp; BLACK PANTHER will be repeat business. May is stacked, and early indications suggest BP will see a ton of repeat viewings. Just sayin, it‚Äôs gonna be fun to watch
@KevinMcCarthyTV It ain‚Äôt easy to clear $200M in three days. CIVIL WAR had tremendous buzz and BLACK PANTHER crushed those opening numbers too. Just saying it‚Äôs not a sure thing - IW needs to do some work to get it there
@Melanism I think that‚Äôs a no brainer- just depends on how much they have to lean into
Then once we‚Äôre past opening weekend, #InfinityWar kicks off what might be the biggest May we‚Äôve ever seen, with a DEADPOOL sequel two weeks later followed by a STAR WARS movie a week after that. Will #BlackPanther top 2018 at the box office? It just might
A lot of people coming at me thinking #InfinityWar is guaranteed to clear #BlackPanther‚Äôs numbers and I just don‚Äôt know about that. BP opened bigger than ULTRON in 3-day and is about to open bigger than the first AVENGERS in the 4-day. https://t.co/6CwTLS2h2G
Fact: #BlackPanther crushed it at the box office this weekend. Spending Presidents Day morning talking all about its massive debut on TV and radio https://t.co/2Z3JyVi9n3
UPDATE: #BlackPanther nabbed the second best Sunday of all time (behind only THE FORCE AWAKENS), and its 3-day total has risen to $201M. Some are now saying it could do $243M for 4-day, which would make it 2nd all time. Damn.
#BlackPanther marks the 10th Certified Fresh movie in a row for @MarvelStudios. The last of only two MCU movies not to go CF was THOR: THE DARK WORLD. Name another studio that‚Äôs put out ten CF movies in a row. That‚Äôs damn impressive. üçÖ https://t.co/DLbCGZA3PC
@sgscottieg614 Will it?
RT @Fandango: 11.21.2018 https://t.co/HchdeU0k5K
@Ike_Gold It includes Thurs night, Fri, Sat and Sunday. These numbers may shift slightly on Monday AM, but not by much. Likely to land somewhere around $218-220M for the entire four days
After only three days in theaters, #BlackPanther has already exceeded the entire domestic gross of THOR, ANT-MAN, CAP: THE FIRST AVENGER &amp; INCREDIBLE HULK, and it will pass THE DARK WORLD by tomorrow https://t.co/zw16IoFNSQ
UPDATE: $192M is the official 3-day number for #BlackPanther, just topping AGE OF ULTRON ($191M) for the MCU‚Äôs second best opening ever (5th all time) and absolutely crushing all previous February records.
@frankpallotta üôÑ
@frankpallotta This was always a fairly coveted holiday weekend at the box office, but after this movie I think this weekend becomes a much bigger deal
Note that if this movie can top $226M in four days, it beats THE AVENGERS opening four-day total and certainly rivals that film for Marvel‚Äôs best opening ever. 
(p.s. it‚Äôs February)
Early estimates for #BlackPanther peg it at $194M for the weekend, which would top AGE OF ULTRON ($191M) for Marvel Studios‚Äô 2nd Best opening ever and give it the 5th best opening of all time. https://t.co/ongNH8qvMx

@FLIIEaglesFLII Two stingers - as for trailers, nothing that hasn't previously been released online, from what I know
@filmadelphia @mattsinger It was a Cap movie. The graphic includes movies starring characters who had not previously been featured in their own MCU movie.
@AshCrossan @pablohidalgo You should've saved this for the junket interviews, Ash
@5States @mikeryan @mattsinger Solo will not die in Solo, tho
@filmadelphia @mattsinger They did not include Avengers because those characters had already been featured in an MCU movie. The Guardians we had not seen prior to their debut film
@mikeryan @mattsinger Solo is a Solo movie, but not an MCU solo movie. It's a Star Wars Solo solo movie, though
@mikeryan @mattsinger Solo is not an MCU solo movie, Mike. It's a Star Wars movie. They are separate, but released by the same studio, so I can see where you would make that error

@xNikkiyx The movie is set in Africa and features an ensemble of actors playing members of varying African tribes, hence me calling it a beautiful African movie
@xNikkiyx From its music to its setting to its characters, there is a beautiful African vibe that surrounds this movie and embraces its every moment. That is what I meant by "100% African"

This is great. I love hearing about all of the different groups and churches renting out entire theaters for #BlackPanther. This is most definitely a film that deserves to be celebrated in that way https://t.co/KK1t70NOzD

The best part of #BlackPanther is how it unravels this deeply emotional &amp; complex story about family ties &amp; protecting your tribe. While lots will tout Michael B. Jordan as the stand-out, my favs were Danai Gurira &amp; especially BP's lil sis, Letitia Wright https://t.co/VSEwa98BnI

#Sundance favorites for me: 
EIGHTH GRADE
BURDEN
ASSASSINATION NATION
THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS, THE TALE
THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST
MONSTERS AND MEN https://t.co/l8aSRcIe4x
@rejects @Filmdrunk I can respect that
@Filmdrunk I respect that opinion but I don‚Äôt agree with it

EIGHTH GRADE/ASSASSINATION NATION double feature ftw 
#Sundance https://t.co/oiNyVx4Op4
Odessa Young, Bella Thorne, Hari Nef, Abra demolish the movie. PURGE-esque, HEATHERS-esque, crazy entertaining and everything a wild Midnight movie should be.
ASSASSINATION NATION is friggin‚Äô brilliant! A sick, slick, stylish, hilarious, wickedly violent tale about the dangers of social media in the age of the mob mentality. 
#Sundance https://t.co/RRisT5vH1q
We all see different things in the art we consume and we should always strive to be respectful of that. If you dig something someone else doesn‚Äôt, then that‚Äôs all good. That‚Äôs supposed to happen. Embrace it and talk about it. 
#Sundance
@WorlJam It‚Äôs a complicated film and the reaction will certainly be mixed, in part because the film lingers with him as a klansman for a good while.
@Die_Wil_Wheaton I agree, talk about someone who course corrected their career and is taking on some great roles right now
Loved THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST, about a teen (@ChloeGMoretz) forced to attend a gay conversion camp. Funny and biting w/ powerful messages about being the person you want to be. A fest fav for me
#Sundance https://t.co/8jX3FYTUSw
@frankpallotta This was inspired by a buddy who went on a date to a horror movie recently
THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS is both mind blowing and heartbreaking - such a fascinating doc about a set of triplets separated at birth who accidentally find each other 20 years later. Some crazy twists in this one
#Sundance https://t.co/c5ODLsj44F
This is great, not all theaters have this. https://t.co/i9A2xIlfIP
The first draft of the BURDEN script was written in 1998. Forrest Whitaker became attached in 2006. The film was finally made in 2016, debuting at #Sundance in 2018. Took a minute, but this film is gonna make some noise this year
@SandroCorsaro Oh believe me, we are all counting down the days
BURDEN is the strongest film I have seen at #Sundance so far. Exceptional performances from Garrett Hedlund and Andrea Riseborough in the real life story of a Klansman who finds love &amp; eventually redemption https://t.co/pnYWA5kYxc
Eagles/Patriots Super Bowl is like a living nightmare for New York sports fans. Is there any way for both of them to lose?
Not a dry eye in the house for WHAT THEY HAD, a warm but heartbreaking film about a family who rally around their mother as she loses her memory due to Alzheimer‚Äôs. Some big laughs but lots of tears, too. I‚Äôm kind of a mess

I finally got to meet and hang out with my fav Tessa Thompson tonight, so I‚Äôm good. I can leave #Sundance now.
Update: At the Sorry to Bother You after party, I asked Armie Hammer if his line of coke was indeed the longest line ever snorted in a movie and he laughed, and said ‚ÄúThat line would kill anyone who attempted it.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs @TessaThompson_x on new roles, new opportunities, new voices and how excited she is that movies like SORRY TO BOTHER YOU now have a chance to exist

@TessaThompson_x Also Armie Hammer may have broken the record for longest line of cocaine snorted in a movie. We‚Äôll need to dig into that some more. This movie is so crazy
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU is funny, inventive, wildly absurd and, thanks to @TessaThompson_x‚Äôs character Detroit, features maybe the best earring collection ever.

The first trailer for the #Sicario sequel is out and it's rad. I've spoken to people who've seen this and they say it's fantastic. Can't wait.

@Sean_OConnell Ridley Scott just deleted a main character and reshot all his scenes in, like, a day. I say buckle in and bring on May 2018!
No way! As a movie fan, how do you not want an Avengers film and a Star Wars film to come out in the same month?? I say bring it on! https://t.co/sJZvY33Lc7
@ssantos16 @ManaByte Because I think it's important for Star Wars to remind us not to take Star Wars so damn seriously all the time. To let go, to embrace a different experience. It's the only way for the series to live on
I think more than one #StarWars movie has produced great writing, but I agree that #TheLastJedi has inspired a lot of fantastic pieces, from ones about inclusion to loss to its themes and how it kinda trolls Star Wars fans. Lots of variety https://t.co/YUjYB2ic14

@paulscheer @Sean_OConnell @MdellW @jenyamato @bdgrabinski @slashfilm @jeffcannata @DannyTRS Exactly, she is way more practical than spiritual. In order to ever see that from her, it has to use her instead of her using it
In order for these brands to evolve, they need to take risks. In order for them to take risks, we need to let go of taking it all too seriously. In order to let go, we need to laugh - both at it and at ourselves
Interesting to see how reactions differ between Thor: Ragnarok and Last Jedi. Both films become borderline genre parodies at times, but w/ Thor, it‚Äôs way more accepting. Is it because of director? Prior expectations? Both?
@slashfilm @jeffcannata @DannyTRS I dug it lots, it more establishes Poe as a guy too confident for his own good

@epophoto @rubinsafaya @cevangelista413 @slashfilm It's an interesting debate! I would say the rating should be about the film and not the conversation around the film. You are not rating the larger cultural conversation, you are rating the movie
@rubinsafaya @cevangelista413 @slashfilm This is true, except in 2500 reviews, every one of his B- reviews he has marked Fresh
@cevangelista413 @slashfilm So I think another interesting discussion point is whether or not he broke the rules
@cevangelista413 @slashfilm This is a good piece, but one thing not mentioned is whether he broke the rules. Totally agree about not ganging up on an opinion that differs from the norm, but If the critic shows a lack of professionalism &amp; editorial integrity, then it breaks RT's rules

@RottenTomatoes Another happy stat: in the history of Rotten Tomatoes, only 4 films remain a 100% with over 100 reviews, and two of them (Lady Bird, Things to Come) are directed by women
Greta Gerwig‚Äôs #LadyBird (100%, 161 reviews) is only 3 Fresh reviews away from topping TOY STORY 2 (100%, 163 reviews) to become the film w/ the most reviews at 100% in @RottenTomatoes history. https://t.co/HCJNFboksg
And I love how the movie ends leaving you teary-eyed, yes, but hopeful. Hopeful that even when there‚Äôs darkness in the world, people will rally around one another and support one another. Movies like this are important right now. They matter
I have a child who is being bullied at school this year, and it‚Äôs been a bit chaotic in my life, to say the least. I‚Äôm thankful films like WONDER exist that address bullying on a level that kids can understand and relate to
I‚Äôve seen critics come at WONDER for being sappy &amp; emotionally exploitive, but I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. I think it speaks to families in ways that incite honest &amp; important conversations
Received a screener of #Wonder, but went back to watch it again on the big screen with my crew. Huge applause at the end, and I still can‚Äôt make it through the ‚ÄúOur Town‚Äù scene without soaking my shirt in tears. Just a sweet movie w/ great messages https://t.co/4cVcU55buj
@GermainLussier I‚Äôm not surprised by the movement - dude did release an extended cut for BvS, so I could see how fans might think another extended cut exists here. They should just tack on some footage for the Blu-ray &amp; call it a day

@SteveKornfeld I actually like how they hid Superman from the marketing. I give WB credit - they are probably the most protective studio when it comes to spoilers. They also hid a lot w/ Blade Runner 2049 too. It may hurt them sometimes, but I respect that about them
@Trevor56510778 I agree
For a positive box office story, see #Wonder ($27mil) and check out both #LadyBird (2.5m) and #ThreeBillboards ($1.1m), the latter two on over 2,000 less screens than the 7 films above them https://t.co/WE9oKhmyg9

#JusticeLeague is better than BvS and #SuicideSquad - it's lean, mean &amp; packed w/ superhero action. I dug most of its lighter moments &amp; I think it has one of the best action sequences ever in a DCEU movie. And of course Wonder Woman steals the show. https://t.co/rW3UjpBUMk

@smacberry @DarrenAronofsky I do not think there is any one message in this film. Yes, JL is very obviously mother earth, but I think its themes speak to all creation
@msvaleriaisabel It's my favorite story -- good luck with the film!
This is my favorite thing @RealGDT has ever done. I love all of his work, but this film is something really, really special
@MusgoHBA For sure
THE SHAPE OF WATER: a sweet, romantic &amp; meticulously beautiful fairytale about the risks we take for the love we long for. I adored it

Moral of the story is you never know when your life will change forever. Sometimes you're just shopping for a backpack in Target...
Now her kid - the red head in the pic above - is in one of the best films of the year AND nailed my favorite moment in the film
It was the 3rd Target she had been to looking for that Vadar backpack &amp; she almost gave up when Baker approached them in an aisle
She almost called security on him and he told her he was casting for a movie and she thought it was a scam.
Spoke to her and her mom tonight. Mom says she was shopping for a Darth Vadar backpack &amp; Baker was stalking them in Target
Favorite behind-the-scenes story at #TIFF is the little girl from THE FLORIDA PROJECT who Sean Baker discovered in a Target in Kissimmee https://t.co/V9XcOAUsOU

First #TIFF movie I walked out of on such a high - it is so friggin' good. Team I, TONYA all the way. Get it into theaters tomorrow!
Allison Janney steals the movie (and will be an Oscar frontrunner), but Margot Robbie is also terrific. Gillespie's best film, hands down
Absolutely loved I, TONYA - shades of Scorsese, the Coens. It's funny, heartbreaking, crazy entertaining. So my jam; fav #TIFF movie so far https://t.co/SdPqlSeaPU

#TIFF https://t.co/rrx7bdxDB6
@kyle_kizu No, Clooney got paid 50k to direct
Clooney also says Oscar Isaac is "the best of that generation that's out there," in terms of actors.
Other Clooney fun bites: He refers to the Coen bros. as "the boys," says original script for this film was called "What Jack Saw"
Films other people won't make. He doesn't need the money; doesn't need to play "the bad guy in a Transformers movie."
He'd like it for people to dig his movies, but if they don't it won't stop him from continually taking risks on films he believes in
Big takeaway is that Clooney is just doing the projects he wants w/ the people he wants. Only took 50k to make Suburbicon
Clooney told the best Oscars story too - way too long for Twitter - about a secret meeting between actors the night before the show
On Suburbicon, fun fact: Josh Brolin played a crazy baseball coach but was cut because it didn't match tonally. Orig script was way goofier
Clooney also says he likes being the guy making the movies no one else will make. Admits some will hit, others will fail. Is what it is
Clooney says he used to read 2-3 scripts a week, now it's 1-2 every couple of months. Wants another Michael Clayton or The Descendants
Was just in a 50-min convo w/ George Clooney, at #TIFF for #Suburbicon. He's definitely not running for office; maybe not acting much either
Finally nabbed a copy of the highly sought after BACKWARDS &amp; IN HEELS at #TIFF.

@ThatJacqueline For Johnny it's less about teaching Daniel than it is about getting back at Kreese, who embarrassed him and played him like a fool
@ThatJacqueline But he is - Johnny is way more experienced in Karate than Daniel. And him returning on the opposing side of Kreese completes his arc
@ThatJacqueline It was all video'd I think, so maybe one day we'll have to post it, even though I'm the one who's right üòâ
@ThatJacqueline I said they should have Rock 3'd it with Miyagi dying midway thru &amp; Johnny stepping in as mentor. @ThatJacqueline strongly disagreed
All I remember from last night was that @ThatJacqueline and I fought for way too long over what the plot of Karate Kid 3 should've been
"Finally a Star Wars package full of toys for girls!" is what the girls in my house shouted upon opening this. üëç

@RottenTomatoes MORE: Add Starkiller Base as a "Death Star" and we're at 82.3%, a slight drop. Remove Force Awakens but add AOTC &amp; it's almost a virtual tie
@mikeryan @GermainLussier @RottenTomatoes AOTC wasn't included in the original gathering - on the fence about it, but we'll run it with and without. ROTS is included
Fun Fact: #StarWars movies that feature the Death Star have an average @RottenTomatoes score of 84.25% vs 76.5% for those that don't https://t.co/2tGQc8OA4x

@GCMcCannMovies Likely read it later this week or early next week
So don't expect some 20-min monologue about some girl some dude has back home. No time for that. It's all go! go! go! Now RUN!
I liked that, tho. In this situation, soldiers &amp; rescuers were all thrown together. No one really knew anyone. It was all about survival
The thing about this film is it very consciously veers away from character development. It's very in-the-moment kinda filmmaking.
Re: #Dunkirk, I had a great chat w/ Nolan last night, actually, and we went deep on one of my favorite scenes, and lots more. Stay tuned...
I saw #Dunkirk in IMAX 70 mm, and if you want the best possible experience of watching this film, you need to see it that way, hands down https://t.co/ARQCJazMLg
@GCMcCannMovies Realistic is an understatement, he went all in on this. I spoke to him about the lack of R-rated grisly warfare &amp; why he stayed away from it
From direction to editing to cinematography to score, w/ #Dunkirk Christopher Nolan proves he is one of the great filmmakers of our time
30 seconds in, Nolan once again delivers a spectacular edge-of-your-seat opening sequence. And then it just keeps upping the tension

@ManaByte @toothlessbum It's a 90 minute panel, and Marvel will want the mic drop. That's how they roll. It'll be a show, no doubt, regardless of D23
At Comic Con, they call it a "sizzle" - trust, there's no way they don't drop something. Guardians showed a sizzle 12 days into production https://t.co/QUffgsxPE7
If I were to guess, I bet it ends with the entire Infinity War cast taking the stage with the drop of the first trailer https://t.co/oXtN0OYlOk
@movie_hangover For sure, it elevates the movie in such a major way
@Reaps11 I meant debut as in its opening weekend
$120 mil would give it the second highest debut (domestic) for a Spider-Man movie. Only Spider-Man 3 ($151 mil) tops that https://t.co/HWXMRPIdin

@GermainLussier @Sean_OConnell Davis was in there last year - that was even bigger
@mccrabb_will Waiting for hope
Not in the Jon Watts piece I'm doing is him saying he visited the #AvengersInfinityWar set recently. His reaction: "It's gonna be crazy."
@ThatJacqueline I don't think so, it doesn't look like it's hitting his face
@mikeryan I bought he Ghostbusters II soundtrack on cassette, so I can relate

@thefilmcynic I can top it - when I was there last year my kid got a nasty case of head lice
@thefilmcynic Now post a selfie 10 hours from now so we can see if you're still smiling
@jackcox997 Poorly worded title, didn't mean to make it sound like he owned the trilogy, just that he is moving on from one trilogy to maybe another
@Darrellict I should've put it in all caps

https://t.co/n6KUEhP4sE https://t.co‚Ä¶
@ScottWamplerBMD @GermainLussier @AshCrossan @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty Please ask to speak with Harry himself if possible. He's the only one who knows it all
@ThatJacqueline Awesome, hope you have a great day!
@ScottWamplerBMD @GermainLussier @AshCrossan @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty I believe it was his first day on the job, the day we got there
@ThatJacqueline Happy B-day, yo! Drinks on me next time I see ya... so, next week?
@ScottWamplerBMD @GermainLussier @AshCrossan @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty Wasn't it his first day on the job, though, and we had like 15 people who all wanted separate checks. That's brutal
@GermainLussier @AshCrossan @ScottWamplerBMD @elmayimbe @colliderfrosty This poor waiter in Orlando has no idea how much he comes up in Twitter convos
@horasperdidas Yes, I have already added it to my watch list.
But then I tossed him one he hadn't seen: The Last American Virgin. An all-timer for me &amp; the best ending. Always love touting that one
Jon Watts &amp; I spoke a lot about coming-of-age movies in our chat, &amp; he tossed one out that I actually haven't seen: L√©olo. It sounds amazing
@elmayimbe @GermainLussier @colliderfrosty I like the cheaper version that involves a group text and the name of a local bar
@edgarwright Oh, it doesn't have to be in any way - I was just joking. Definitely down for more, though.

Agreed - and good hanging with you last night, Rob! https://t.co/SmQFlklhvy
Still VERY early for Spidey, but 96% places it as the highest rated live action superhero movie ever. It'll likely drop, but great start https://t.co/2owo526J1r
@GermainLussier @bangeleno Oh I hit every one of those food trucks
@mymayabee @TalkCrude I think if you like The Fifth Element and that bold, colorful type of unfamiliar sci-fi, then you'll dig it.
@GermainLussier @bangeleno p.s. The pizza in the back was pretty bomb

@JasonGuerrasio Plenty but I live in the NOW
The cool thing about this summer is that Baby Driver, The Big Sick, Spidey, Apes &amp; Wonder Woman are all movies that live up to the hype https://t.co/oy4VZJzqws
@mikeryan The spinoff, yeah
Not that spectacle isn't still important - it'll always be important. But they're leaning more into character &amp; some are really benefiting
LOGAN, SPIDEY, APES &amp; even the BUMBLEBEE movie - I like how we're trending toward smaller-scale character-driven blockbusters over spectacle https://t.co/VnhVhBhtUn
By next month, #WonderWoman will likely overtake GUARDIANS VOL. 2 at the box office to become summer's biggest moneymaker domestically https://t.co/FmPncJTLeM
@Darrellict @GermainLussier I may actually see you tomorrow D üòâ
@kumailn Other films debuted on 4 screens with more money, but most of those also earned Oscar nods. So see the film &amp; get it some Oscar nods!
@GermainLussier @Darrellict @SD_Comic_Con Just landed actually
Since 2013, when it comes to films that opened on 5 screens, only LA LA LAND (14 Oscar nods) debuted w/ more than @kumailn's #TheBigSick https://t.co/X1bVFJ0xHR

@pj_campbell @robertliefeld @shawnxmadden @mikeamessina ...only Spidey is in Marvel Studios' MCU
@pj_campbell @robertliefeld @shawnxmadden @mikeamessina I will transcribe the full quote shortly and put it up but she essentially said that while they are ALL Marvel comics characters....
Pascal said she was itching to clarify that after the story this week. Those other movies will not take place in the MCU
FYI: Just spoke w/ Amy Pascal &amp; Kevin Feige who clarified that Venom, Black Cat, etc are in the Marvel comics universe but not the MCU
Just talked about #SpiderManHomecoming on @CBSNewYork w/ @AndreaGrymesTV &amp; now it's time to dig in w/ the folks who made it. Stay tuned... https://t.co/LGvIz2Yk0H
@mattsinger This is a good tweet, but is it a fun tweet?
@VogtRoberts Early March don't count for summer! But I do think Logan/Kong is the year's best back-to-back so far
Guardians, Wonder Woman, Baby Driver, Big Sick, Spider-Man, Apes - all great, entertaining movies. I'm down with this summer so far...
And I'll toss out one more thing - ya got 2 post-credits scenes, so stick around. The second one is so good
#SpidermanHomecoming
@Darrellict It's so well written and all the comic timing is terrific. Maybe one of the best Marvel scripts yet I'd say
@Darrellict C'mon DB - those CA videos are so great
Oh, and the biggest MCU scene stealer is not Tony Stark üòâ
Spot on casting, spot on Spidey - the audience had a blast. My 18 year old nephew says it's "spectacular" &amp; his favorite Marvel film yet
My favorite thing about this Spidey film is that it was so outer-boro NY. Queens, Brooklyn &amp; Staten Island represent!!!
#SpiderManHomecoming is SUCH a good time. Fun, inventive action w/ some of the best humor in a Marvel film yet. Great start for MCU Spidey! https://t.co/8kTnG6wtO2

I've been lucky enough to speak to a bunch of filmmakers w/ major summer movies this year, but this chat was by far my longest.
Earlier this week I had a chance to interview someone I've always wanted to talk to. I was nervous but it turned out to be a fantastic convo
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES began screening last night in LA and I hear it's tremendous. I see it Weds - can't wait! https://t.co/FNMuQ68CIE
@connieshih I thought JW was harmless and BoH is the farthest thing from Star Wars - they are in a different universe of moviemaking.
As Trevorrow has said himself, he has a massively talented team at his disposal. Hence, it isn't The Book of Henry
Wow I didn't realize people would be so vile towards the dude. What I meant was Star Wars is a completely different situation
Star Wars fans shouldn't be concerned because The Book of Henry isn't a Star Wars movie üòâ https://t.co/TAWhpV8FeR

@mattsinger Cannot wait to watch this -- missed it at Tribeca
@pardonater I think if a movie works, it works as a whole, and knowing lines or plot points should not hinder the experience of watching it
Personally I watch a ton of trailers, but I'm not as bothered by spoilers. I just love trailers. But if you want to go in clean, go in clean
@loveofcinemasf8 Then don't complain! Ha!
I always laugh when people complain that too much of a movie is spoiled in its trailers. Here's an idea - don't watch the trailers then!

I actually liked what the "It" was and thought it was refreshing that a film didn't just give us what we were expecting based on its trailer https://t.co/ITLOngU0aJ
@Koutchboom Nope
@blumhouse Also: I believe this is about a girl who must relive the same day over &amp; over until she figures out who is trying to kill her.
Okay, you have my attention...
(p.s. This is a @blumhouse joint) https://t.co/TsQSrXqvEG
@TheSpencerPerry Yeah THE WITCH had similar issues. Both are more psychological thrillers &amp; I think audiences were expecting more monster-ish stuff
@Chris_Laudando I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so just trying to speak generally about it
Only thing I can chalk it up to (cause it's a very good film) is that audiences were expecting something different w/ a bigger payoff
Since 1998, IT COMES AT NIGHT is the best-reviewed film (86%) to receive less than a ‚ÄúC-‚Äú Cinemascore. The divide on this one is odd...
@mattsinger I don't understand this scandal -- isn't the whole point of this show is that people hook up?

@PastTenseOfJav I am a huge Taika fan, and think he's brilliant. Was just listing directors who went from small budgeted films to blockbusters.
@jtanner79 I'd say so, more unsettling tho. I know I keep using that word, but it really is the best way to describe the feeling of watching this film
This movie is so unsettling. Just so, so unsettling, and a pretty masterful psychological thriller. https://t.co/zWR4SN3LgF
@jhoffman It's super unsettling horror
@fangirlJeanne @Msblerdess @Fandango I'm a huge fan of Taika - I think he's brilliant. Just pointing out directors who went from smaller budgeted movies to big ones.

@katerbland @JasonGuerrasio I remember when @mikeryan &amp; I interviewed Joel Kinnaman at comic con and he was vaping. First time I had ever seen that during an interview
@THR Like, how an indie director is on the verge of debuting one of the best reviewed superhero films of all time. Let's see that angle more
P.S. I don't mean to bash @THR as these "gamble" stories did exist before WW. Would just prefer a fresher narrative 
https://t.co/UQLbbMiWm9
@Filmdrunk @selashiloni Maybe you're right - tried searching for Jurassic World, didn't find one. But curious to see the angle taken on all those other movies
Or remember when Disney gambled their third THOR sequel on some quirky New Zealander whose previous film cost $1.6 million?? https://t.co/XkQc5JBYPR
Or remember when Sony gambled $230 million on a SPIDER-MAN reboot on an indie director whose previous film cost $7.5 million? https://t.co/XkQc5JBYPR
Or remember when Universal gambled $150 million on a JURASSIC PARK sequel on some indie director whose previous film was made for $750,000?? https://t.co/XkQc5Jknrh

@joshuarshultz I disagree, I don't always agree with the average critic score but I agree with it more than I don't agree with it
@jhoffman I think it's still a superhero movie. I think Scream, for example, is still a horror movie
Also, at 97%, Wonder Woman is tied with The Incredibles for best reviewed superhero movie ever, period.

Can't get into spoilers, but I will say the relationship/chemistry between Gadot and Pine is my favorite part of the movie. https://t.co/c8bFolQy7w
I would say, yes. Keep in mind there is some WWI imagery that may be a little scary for young ones (gas masks, etc). 
#WonderWoman https://t.co/0s3PbjuJhP
@Shaun_Wren It has a refreshing fish-out-of-water element that is really fun to watch play out

Great to see all the positive #WonderWoman reactions. The movie strikes a terrific balance b/t action, adventure, humor &amp; romance. Not easy https://t.co/hOOootvrDo
WONDER WOMAN is great. My favorite of the recent DC movies. It's fierce, funny, well-written and badass. @GalGadot owns it. Her lasso FTW https://t.co/rQ0ufZxWXP
