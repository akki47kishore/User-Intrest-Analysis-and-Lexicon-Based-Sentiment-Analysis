@chamblee54 @RememberThisPod This is the first time I've tweeted in a week.
@simbolism1 I honestly have no idea.
@Chris_Tonick I can. I worked there in 1998 and it was a toxic waste dump.
Like, I spent spent so much time squinting at current and faded child stars wearing sweatpants in Gelson's that his looks don't look odd to me at all. But I can't prove it. There was no paparazzi then. I went on Getty and searched "Gelson's" and only got photos of soccer.
As a native of Studio City, the recent fascination with Shia's "off duty" fashion taps into a weird free-floating nostalgia for me that I have a hard time putting into words. I feel like he falls into a great tradition that was the wallpaper of my life from the mid-80s-late-90s.

2018 Karina to 2008 Karina: In ten years you will go to SXSW and not open Twitter once while you're there. 
2008 Karina: Because your whole social life will have moved over to Foursquare?
@emilyyoshida The last time I was in Austin (September 16) there was no Uber, only an extremely friendly local-only version, so if they've allowed Uber in for SXSW, that in itself is bad news
Extremely boring season of Top Chef enlivened only by Tom Colicchio's open boredom and disdain for the middling contestants.

It's very exciting that @UCLAFTVArchive is screening Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead on March 12! One of preteen Karina's favorite films. I rewatched it a couple of years ago and was stunned by how well it held up/how good it is. Applegate's character/performance=A++++

@andrewsampson_ I haven't seen it yet. I don't really believe that films get "snubbed" in most categories (the Academy is not getting together and deciding to exclude films). But nominees in this category are chosen by a committee, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@becroll Haven't seen it yet. They showed a terrible trailer at the theater where I saw Loveless last weekend.
...that it succeeds as much as it does is pretty remarkable. &lt;/end Oscar Thoughts&gt;
But it's now clear to me that what The Square is trying to do is so much more ambitious than what any other film in the category is trying to do, and it's attempting to grapple with so many ideas, and even though I still don't think it's batting 1.000...
There are good movies nominated; I only really disliked one of them, and I probably most enjoyed watching On Body and Soul.
Basically, I saw The Square first, months ago, and didn't totally get it, and was frankly more annoyed by it than impressed. Then I watched every other movie in the category.

@mimbale My sense from being around voting people in LA is that no one is watching it. There's still the idea that a Netflix movie isn't "real" -- no one is watching the Baumbach movie or Okja for awards consideration, either.

@antkaufman ...its genre has basically been relegated to TV.
@antkaufman It totally is meant as a compliment! I think Mudbound is an excellent example of what is wrongly looked down on as a "low" genre, the romantic, historic social issue melodrama. If it's a criticism at all it's just that Mudbound feels kind of like TV, but maybe that's because...
For those on the edge of your seats: I went to see The Square &amp; watched Mudbound on Netflix. I preferred Mudbound. It reminded me of my fave Hallmark Channel movie, in which Felicity is arranged married to Skeet Ulrich, solves Japanese internment https://t.co/mx9XPPuZY7 https://t.co/iCaXVMfXaS

@miss_ctan @npratc I‚Äôm traveling and not available today, but thanks for thinking of me!
@originaluyf1950 @Joelsherman1 From my experience I would say it is incorrect to say that few people know or remember that fact.
@RememberThisPod These were the last episodes of the podcast that I made entirely on my own, choosing every sound effect, mixing the music, etc. They will sound a little different from more recent episodes because I was not a professional audio editor. FYI, don‚Äôt @ me, please enjoy, etc.
Charles Manson is dead. In 2015, I made a series of @RememberThisPod episodes about him as a wannabe star and his connections and reverberations through late 60s/70s Hollywood: https://t.co/1HFw5rU76f
There is a lot of her in this episode on her boyfriend, who was Doris Day‚Äôs son/ an associate of Charles Manson: https://t.co/MUlYUK7Ql9 https://t.co/NEZZbhjAtu

@marclamb *shrug* I liked it better than season 3
@brightidea21 @RememberThisPod I promise you I'm working very hard on the new podcast season. Sometimes I have to take a five minute break to think about something else.
@craigtminami Honestly, my single father's weeknight dinner repertoire was 75% Gelson's ready-to-cook:  turkey meatloaf, turkey meatballs, chicken fajitas
As someone who has spent most of my life living near them, I am deeply Gelson's brand loyal, and I just hoped for better representation.
...but they clearly didn't shoot it at that Gelson's, and the exterior is not the UCB on Franklin. Missed opportunity for LA authenticity!
But instead, she's apparently going to the Gelson's on Franklin near Beachwood Canyon, bc she walks out of it and into UCB, which, fine...
...because they have a wine bar! And from walking past it on my way to shop, it seems like it has a late-in-life singles scene!
If Joshy lives in Silverlake,as we've been told he does, his mom would be going to the Silverlake Gelson's, which would have been perfect...
I love Transparent, but in season four I'm troubled by its inaccurate depiction of something that means a lot to me: Gelson's.
@ryanpmcguffey It would be great to reform a troll while he's young!

@vrizov I read the Mad Man pilot recently and thought it was pretty great.
@KennyJive @RememberThisPod Why would you tweet this?
@brooksbarnesNYT Thanks for mentioning @RememberThisPod in your @TandCmag story on Fonda! But, Jean &amp; Jane was the 9th season, not the 3rd
I feel like the idea that this just what powerful men do needs to be eroded, and the way to do that is by being very specific, not general
Of course this has always happened in Hollywood. But to couch HW's crimes as, like,mogul tradition feels like it undercuts his specific evil
Like, comparing Weinstein to past, sexually abusive moguls puts him in a canon of "great men," and sort of lets him off the hook.
The more I think about it, the "this has been happening for 100 years/Harvey is just like Darryl Zanuck" argument gives HW too much credit https://t.co/BIYexzGu0E

.@RememberThisPod What I wonder is, why? Why would a hotel (particularly one in a fairly isolated region of Italy) need to worry about music royalties?
.@RememberThisPod These themes are 25-60 seconds long, so it was very apparent (probably only to me) when they would loop/repeat.
.@RememberThisPod The weirdest place was at the bar of a hotel in the Amalfi coast, where they had about half a dozen royalty free classical themes on loop
When I used to edit @RememberThisPod, I bought some  comps of royalty free music. It's weird how often I hear those tracks out in the world

@carterradams sometimes it feels like he's capturing the essence of Hughes. Sometimes it feels like he's revealing Warren Beatty.
Rules Don't Apply was prob never going to be a blockbuster but opening it on 2000+ theaters was insane.
@annoyingworld yes but you can't let that (or any of the other issues of willful manipulating of the historical record) bother you.
Disappointing that the narrative on Rules Don't Apply will be that it "bombed." It's prob Beatty's least great film but I still loved it.

@Captain_Idaho There is a whole season about Charles Manson...
(But in the context of the film internet circa 2005, that was sort of a big deal, I guess.) Anyway! #cinematical
Cinematical wasn't, like, a feminist plot. There were just girls writing about what they liked, alongside boys writing about what they liked
I mean, there were a lot of things that made Cinematical unique, but one thing was that it had strong female voices from the beginning.
Unspoken aspect of this is presence of female voices @Cinematical, which I'm not even sure I was aware of c.2005 https://t.co/bIbuEaaKMy

@connorland2: in part b/c many women in power in the industry still have to cede to men &amp; female audiences are ghettoized/underestimated
@connorland2: its less important for movies to present a fantasy of female power,but they're more derelict in reflecting actual female power
@connorland2: but more commonly actresses were women whose lives weren't entirely their own, playing fantasies of power/independence/freedom
@connorland2: the exceptions were big stars like Joan Crawford who had costar approval, or K Hepburn who acted as an (uncredited) producer

You could replace the vegetables with pasta! No wonder you'd then need a spanking.
I'm not kidding about the noodles. Like for lunch, she'd recommend broth, a broiled lamb chop and a spoonful of spinach OR buttered noodles.
RT @selfstyledsiren: @KarinaLongworth Madame Sylvia was SO not selling diets.
Now you know.
Anyway, Madame Sylvia's "method" involved a lot of buttered noodles, and she'd basically spank her clients in the spots they wanted to slim.
It could only have been more embarrassing for me if anyone had know that this was, in fact, an instructive diet book.
The librarian couldn't go get it himself, so he had to make a phone call and say "Hollywood Undressed" aloud in the silent library.
Yesterday at the library I filled out a form to request a book called "Hollywood Undressed" by Madame Sylvia, a '20s diet guru to the stars.

@vrizov: stopped using GR &amp; then I guess it became useful again when Amazon started asking if I wanted to buy stuff from my To Read list
I'm getting the check. Thanks for your questions. They were better than the chicken.
@Bassman_PhD: I look for actors if I want it to feel like a real character and don't feel confident in my ability to make that happen myself
@cobblehillis: maybe in September
@kateyrich: thought I was maybe too hard on Melcher but the whole thing of him wanting to make a teen Manson girl his "maid" was obvs worst

One of the things that makes me feel so sad about the Manson stories is thinking about how these lost girls turned into killer zombies. So.
Also, summer fashion seems to be drifting toward the scruffy pole of "boho." I walk around &amp; feel surrounded by high-fashion Manson girls.
