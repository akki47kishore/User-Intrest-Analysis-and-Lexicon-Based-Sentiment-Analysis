RT @JJWatt: Gutted for @AaronRodgers12. 
Hate to see it.
@JBFlint So your misogynist remark is rooted in some long-ago “clash” I don’t recall? Boo-hoo. Get over it, Joe.
@JBFlint Yes, we could have argued BH’s pos/neg points but you didn’t focus on my subject matter. Instead, you made your tweet about me personally
@claytoncargill @BradWellsNFL @JBFlint The fat cat NFL owners can try but the Pack (not owned by a fat cat) was among the first responders to support each player’s stance.
@JBFlint You could and should have disagreed with the subject I tweeted about but you didn’t. Instead, you made it about me without knowing facts.
@JBFlint You’re a misogynist asshole for thinking women can’t know sports. Have you covered NFL teams? I did it in both Baltimore and Boston for AP.

Trump claims his debate mic was "defective." Yes, it was on.

One of Hillary knockout punches https://t.co/gWKgN4ZUz6
Once again, Hillary Clinton was under intense pressure and she exceeded anyone's expectation.
Not even Trump surrogates can spin this debate as his win. Donald blew it 30 minutes in.
Hillary uses Trump's mistake insulting her "look" to remind America about his despicable attitude towards women. Yay!
Donald just repeated that Hillary doesn't have "Presidential look." This from Trump trout pout.
Trump has no facts at the ready. Maybe the next debate - if there is a 2nd and 3rd debate and he doesn't wimp out - he'll prepare.
Hillary knows she's won this debate. She needs a touchdown signature dance at the podium.
OK, a ref needs to stop this debate. Trump is now unhinged.
Hillary looks like the cat who just ate the canary when Lester Holt called out Trump for lying about supporting the war in Iraq.
Watch how Trump debates like Pee-wee Herman when she corrects his lies: "Wrong." "Wrong." "Wrong."
Didn't Jimmy Carter get ridiculed for using his daughter Amy as an example? Didn't Trump just do the thing with his son Baron?
Hillary now has Trump defending Russian cyber-attacks? Claiming we don't know who did it? Yes we do: his bromance Putin!
Lester Holt is back in control of this debate and Trump. Finally!
Donald Trump is too sick to be President. He keeps snorting.
Yes! Hillary hits Trump with "his long record of engaging in racist behavior" by making him defend his refusal to rent to blacks.
Knock-out punch by Hillary that she prepared for this debate and is prepared for the Presidency.
Hillary just mentioned mental health and should add: "Donald, you're the result of Republicans cutting mental health funding for decades."
Trump just got fact-checked by Lester H
Hillary, ask Trump how he would know about black lives since he doesn't go into 'those areas' and wouldn't rent to 'those people'
Hillary, please hit Trump on his bankruptcies!
All those psychological studies Hillary and her team consulted to get under Trump's skin was time well spent. He's on defensive.
Wow, Hillary has Trump on the ropes. He's feeling forced to give a commercial for his D.C. hotel.
Hillary is really getting under Trump's skin by attacking his wealth and his business debts and his unpaid workers.
The Trump trout pout. He looks like a petulant little boy who's angry and flailing and gonna cry.
Hillary just landed a huge punch to Trump about why he's not releasing his tax returns. Gotcha!
Trump is starting to sound like he's at one of his rallies: shouting, lying, bullying. Ugh.
Trump is saying anything that comes into his head: "Hillary has been fighting Isis all of her adult life." On what planet?
Lester Holt has lost control of this debate 25 minutes in. By allowing Trump to constantly interrupt her with his lies.
"Donald, I know you live in your own reality." Good line!
Was that Trump's hand shaking as he takes slug after slug of water? Isn't that what Donald insulted 'Little Marco' for?
So Trump is going to ignore Lester Holt? And act condescending to Hillary?
Hillary hits Trump early on. By raising the $14 million which his father loaned him. He looked like she hit him in the jaw.

Nothing more needs to be said. The Devil tells The Donald: 'I approve of your speech.' https://t.co/8gIcugHtcU
The second-to-last person in U.S. capable of improving race relations is Donald Trump. Last person? David Duke.
So media says Donald Trump’s hour and 15 minute speech tonight is the longest by any nominee in 40 years. Stop him before he speaks again.
Donald Trump should be saying 'my sole and exclusive mission' is to keep avoiding taxes and hurting immigrants, minorities and women. Ugh!
Don't you love how Donald Trump only talks about pulpits and Christmas as if non-Christian religions don't exist?
It's clear that Donald Trump isn't on a diet for verbiage tonight (or for anything else).
Just hearing Donald Trump say the words 'my first 100 days' in office sent a shiver down my spine. Too scary...
Actually, Donald Trump has proposed the largest tax decrease for millionaires and billionaires like himself.
Why doesn't Donald Trump start by reforming his and Ivanka's own trade deals since they manufacture in China?
If Donald Trump wins the election, the first thing on his agenda will be redecorating the White House with gold leaf
And when Donald Trump refuses to debate her, Hillary Clinton should just debate a chair onstage. Same as his IQ.
I predict Donald Trump will avoid debating Hillary just like he avoided releasing his taxes.

Donald Trump claims he'll 'ensure kids are treated and protected equally.'  Unless they're brown, black, yellow, immigrant, muslim, female.
The very idea that Donald Trump is telling workers 'I am your voice' must be a joke. He just won't pay them after the work is actually done.
Yes, Donald, nobody knows how to GAME the U.S. system with using bankruptcies and ignoring contracts and not paying taxes better than you!
Hillary withstood grilling before Congress for 11 hours. Donald Trump whined that a 3-hour debate with 17 GOP candidates was too long.
When Donald Trump says 'I am the voice,' he's the voice only for the Aryan nation. No blacks, browns, yellows, native or immigrant, allowed.
But, Donald Trump, you're now begging for and accepting big money from special interests who are pulling your strings!
How can Donald Trump have reached this point in the electoral process without being pushed to provide specifics on any policy positions?
After his incomprehensible NATO policies espoused again and again, we know now what Donald Trump would do overseas: abandon U.S. allies.
So this is Donald Trump's big RNC theme: 'Law &amp; Order'? On what planet when he and his staff can't even run an unchaotic convention?
'These are the facts.' Facts? No politician this election has needed more fact-checking which has exposed more lies than Donald Trump.
Donald Trump's use of the word 'humbly' seems most unnatural. Like telling the truth when he prefers to tell lies.
'Who would have believed?' says Donald Trump tonight. Certainly only the racist and bigoted.

No surprise hyper-ambitious Dean Baquet replaces Jill Abramson atop NYTimes. He even publicly dissed her as "a bitchy woman character".
Anna Wintour's awful Kim-Kanye cover only sold less-than-average 250,000 newsstand copies - not the 500,000 previously hyped.
Why NYTimes sucks: This home page blurb on Moms Day - 'I was not alone with the guilty secret of having wished my aged mother dead.'
@neologismist - Journalism is what I do. Powerless to resist. If I had it to do all over again, I'd be badass homicide detective.
Now that Anna Wintour has become Kim Kardashian's bitch, this sell-out editor is past her expiration date at Vogue and Condé Nast.
I'm loving the big backlash aimed at Anna Wintour for putting Kim Kardashian on Vogue cover. Issue should come with barf bag.
Damn, I should have taken an iPhone photo of Graydon Carter sitting in my L.A. living room last Wednesday at 3 PM.

http://t.co/cVgA6AZo7C.
R.I.P. Peter Kaplan, contd: In today's journalism, reporting is often stenography. But Peter demanded all NYO stories have a point of view.
R.I.P. Peter Kaplan, contd: He would have killed to be The New Yorker editor, the perfect outlet for him, but too proud to campaign hard.
R.I.P. Peter Kaplan, the former New York Observer editor-in-chief. Here is what I wrote when he stepped down: http://t.co/zXmU0jP50A
Peter Kaplan was my most inspirational editor. "Write what you know." "Don't leave anything off the page." "You're best when you're angry."
I keep reading and re-reading the NYT obituary for Peter Kaplan, the brilliant New York Observer, not wanting to believe it.
Isn't a magazine defrauding readers and advertisers by pretending to have recent photos of me when in fact the magazine faked the photos?
I said it: “I just think of sitting at 2 AM, chuckling to myself, writing what I consider to be the truth, and just having fun."
I said it: “Being powerful in H'wood was everyone else’s characterization of me. I only cared about telling unvarnished truth about H'wood.”
