Won’t You Be My Neighbor from Morgan Neville has entire audience in tears. His wife said “Don’t make Fred a saint”, but Neville showed why he was special. Focus Features has an Oscar Contender for next year. #sundancefilmfestival

@MarkHarrisNYC @kristapley Agreed. Truth is both movies along with “Get Out” are “small” and Academy is set up to favor “large.”
@melsil Women are trained from birth to empathize with men and stories about men. How many conversations do women have with men who never ask a question about them?
@StevenVoorhees @JanetMaslin @MarkHarrisNYC Well what happens with Timothee Chalamet on A Rainy Day in New York will be interesting.
@MarkHarrisNYC @kristapley A reminder that awards voters are not critics, who have developed more sophisticated ways of assessing merit.
@MarkHarrisNYC @kristapley Right. “What makes this story special?” is the meme I keep hearing on both.
@JanetMaslin @MarkHarrisNYC Agree that actors unwilling to sign with Woody Allen will mark the end of his ability to finance his films.
@kristapley So many men who cannot identify with a story about women dismiss it as marginal. It’s not about them.
