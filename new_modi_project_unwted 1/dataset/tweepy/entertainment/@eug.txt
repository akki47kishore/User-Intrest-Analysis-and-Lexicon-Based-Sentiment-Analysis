Student in audience at film studies panel says comic book movies won't last past the new decade. Biskind agrees its cyclical. #CUFF2015
Haskell taking notes as Biskind &amp; Schrader offer tips abt good tv shows. About one tip, she noted, "Oh yes, David Thomson told me about it!"
Haskell championing role of women in many exciting places w/in entertainment today: TV, stand up comedy, smart blogs, great roles. #CUFF2015
Molly Haskell doesn't think of Hollywood movies as films, they are product. She's not worried abt lack of women in that structure. #CUFF2015
Biskind clarifies, while film schools not needed for production today, need film schools to learn cinema literacy. #CUFF2015
Richard Pe√±a defends film studies at universities for opportunity to teach alongside other arts and disciplines. #CUFF2015
Molly Haskell: "I don't think anybody truly likes critics except other critics." #CUFF2015
At this #CUFF2015 panel abt film studies, Biskind &amp; Schrader don't seem to care abt film school. Haskell and Insdorf in audience defend it.
Will movie theaters exist in 25 yrs? Cinemas will survive as clubs. Fests will too. Multiplexes won't, says Schrader. Biskind disagrees.
Panel discusses: Is Tarantino a cinephile? Connected to film history? Or *just* a voracious movie consumer. #cuff2015 @FilmLinc
