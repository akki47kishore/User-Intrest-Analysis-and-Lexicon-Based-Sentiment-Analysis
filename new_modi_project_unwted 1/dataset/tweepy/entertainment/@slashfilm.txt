What if Avengers 4 ends with Cap back in the past, reunited with Peggy and his ending is being returned to the past to live the rest of his days. It‚Äôs a way to remove him from the current era without killing him, allowing the possibility for Evans to come back down the line.
For anyone freaking out over Chris Evans saying Avengers 4 is his last marvel movie, remember that this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean what you might think it could mean. I think marvels too crafty to allow him to spoil caps ending to the masses...

@richardrushfield I just think they have the length of a season too long. 8-10 is good. And on streaming there is no reason why every episode should be 1 hour long. The story should dictate the length of an episode. These aren‚Äôt airing on a grid so why comply to the standards of old tech?

@hockeysaga Ha, I think the people who really care read the interview. To those who don‚Äôt they maybe read one or two of the breakouts. We don‚Äôt get much pushback at all, just annoying that some people assume its like advertising or something.
@pafifi Still here.
@alexreino Ha, I optimistically think it will and am often times proven wrong.
@FareezyCheesy Basically because most people don‚Äôt want to read a 4,000+ word interview transcript, and some of the details we break out into standalone stories are interesting to those people.
@pafifi ‚Ä¶whole exercise. If we are going to spend 5 days on a set visit, we need to make it worth it for our site, as a business, and worth it to our readers as well.
@pafifi I can confirm for you that the studios don‚Äôt care about how many quantity of articles we produce. They only care for one. Some outlets only do one. We would get invited back with one piece. But many less people would read the coverage and we‚Äôd make much less money from the‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶worth it from a business perspective. This is how this business works. Studios do not pay sites for coverage, as far as I‚Äôve ever seen in 12 years of doing this. People who think otherwise don‚Äôt understand the economics of this business. I hope these tweets gives you some‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ interesting stories that those who might not read a 4,000 word 30 minute long interview might want to read about. Because honestly, not all readers want to read a long interview transcript. And honestly, the traffic for said transcript would not make the many days of effort‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶This is how it works. Doing a set visit is a tremendous time investment, from two long plane flights, to being on set and unavailable to do normal movie news coverage on the site, to many hours of transcription and write-up. To make our efforts worth it we break out‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶or so outlets got the same interviews, we all run it at the same time. If we didn‚Äôt, the coverage would be available elsewhere. This is why when a set visit embargo break happens you see a lot of coverage from it on our site, or any movie site who was on the visit.
For those of you who don‚Äôt know how things work: A studio invites outlets to a set of a movie under the terms of an embargo date for coverage. All the outlets on the visit agree on said embargo date. When the date and time comes, any new info is free game and since a dozen‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ifdE3z9mGp

@bostoncarl Maybe because it didn‚Äôt suck? You‚Äôre apparently in the minority opinion on this one.

@RobTheFiasco I‚Äôm not saying marketing is the deciding factor but saying someone doesn‚Äôt die spoils the tension of that possibility in tentpole action moments. Saying infinity stones don‚Äôt show up spoils no part of the enjoyment of the experience.
@RobTheFiasco Thats different, you are saying something about the movie. Infinity Stones were never teased to be in the movie, it was not a teased possibility, unlike death.

@GermainLussier @KofiOutlaw Even from an expectstions standpoint, knowing they aren‚Äôt in the movie can only increase your enjoyment and lower your disappointment. It definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt your experience of the story.
@KofiOutlaw @GermainLussier I define spoiler as something that spoils the enjoyment of the story itself. This is not in that spoiler and expectations of it are not in the marketing.
@artoo_tweetoo Not really because this is pointing out something actually in the film. These are in the film not at all, not referenced, mentioned, hinted at.
@GermainLussier We choose extreme caution with spoilers, but I don‚Äôt believe this is one in any definition of the word. But we are running circles. Bottom line is we have spoiled nothing for anyone.
@GermainLussier But that‚Äôs a lie to something that actually happens in the film.
@GermainLussier Again, that‚Äôs not the definition of a spoiler. Anyways, I think going in with clearer expectations would only lead to less disappointment and more enjoyment.
@GermainLussier ...oh damn something I think they are leading to isn‚Äôt going to be that because I read that headline. It has no effect on your enjoyment of the story and thus by definition is not a spoiler. If you want to go in unsullied, that‚Äôs another thing entirely.
@GermainLussier I don‚Äôt think it takes a ya from any possibilities in the movie because it‚Äôs never eluded to that there is an infinity stone in the movie what so ever. At no point in this story will someone who is seeing the film for the first time be like...
@perforada The point is you knowing about something that doesn‚Äôt happen in the movie in no way spoils your enjoyment of the film or story whatsoever. It‚Äôs not teased in the marketing or anything. Expectations are not from the film/studio.
@redalert33 I think you misunderstand what spoiler means. Also, just because it doesn‚Äôt appear in the movie doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not in wakanda.
@TheCMH Then don‚Äôt read the internet. Sorry we are not responsible for catering to this level of spoilerphobia.

@Cbake1369 @Ethan_Anderton @iamchoppah It‚Äôs not a position in high but a position collaborated by two unrelated people who actually saw the movie itself, that‚Äôs the best we can possibly do. This is the last tweet from me on this matter.
@Cbake1369 @Ethan_Anderton @iamchoppah Respectfully disagree, I would think anybody went to go and totally blind would not read a review or even see a trailer. Our line on spoilers is stricter than 95% of film sites, and we do occasionally do spoiler free reactions for those who want no details.
@Ethan_Anderton @Cbake1369 @iamchoppah For what it‚Äôs worth, we don‚Äôt take this lightly. I have also done the due diligence of talking with another person who saw the movie and they were also under the same belief that it‚Äôs obvious from the start and not a spoiler.

And lets not forget that at least the #XFL was the first to use spydercam during games and cameras on the ground. If they just try to be the NFL they'll fail, they need to differentiate themselves more than they did.

And actually to be fair, the response was 50% ‚Äúthis is 100% accurate‚Äù and 50% ‚Äúyou guys are smug trolling assholes‚Äù which makes it funnier.
Write anything positive about the MCU and ‚Äúyou guys are getting paid by Disney‚Äù. Write a jokey headline making fun of an MCU set photo and ‚Äúyou guys are smug trolling assholes"

@rianjohnson Ha, thanks Rian. I think you'd agree that just because something has been done previously in Star Wars Canon does not mean it is good storytelling. Nor does this moment resolve the climactic situation.
@OldThinkerTube Ridiculous arguement. There must be a good way of setting it up that does not telegraph the surprise. To say it's not possible is stupid
@smwolfson @mattsinger I could be wrong but I believe Snoke said he set up the connection

@mattsinger Apology in advance for any weird typos or spelling‚Äôs, I broke my wrist and taping on Twitter is apparently a lot harder with one hand
@mattsinger ...Project KYLO and REY without killing himself. If the moment we‚Äôre Kylo says you can‚Äôt be doing this it would kill you, is supposed to be a set up, then the set up even seems to be defying the rules it‚Äôs even trying to create.
@mattsinger Saying the connection team to set up is valid point. Doesn‚Äôt seem to add up for me especially because Kylo and Rey continue to share an astral projection after smoke, the one who set up the connection, is killed. Also I don‚Äôt understand how Snoke is able to astral...

@petexnasty @rianjohnson Those fans are stupid. But I think it‚Äôs wrong discount people who might have intelligent criticisms of the film. I love the movie. But I also have some issues which I think are valid.
@NeverOnBrand I have if you questions. 1. how did Snoke supposedly astral project Kylo without killing himself. 2. How does nook know where Ach-to is? 3. Snoke is killed and Yet Kylo/rey share another  connection moment. If this is the same thing why is in either of them killed?
@shawnyflan It does change. Luke would‚Äôve been killed they would‚Äôve gotten to the resistance in stopped the resistance entirely.
@JonnyHanukkah Yes. We recorded entire podcast about this. Feel free to listen to it. Ray and Kylo have astral projection connection after sNike is killed, hows that possible with that one of them dying?

@rianjohnson Rian, If fans actually have a problem with this ability not appearing in the legends book, then thats just STUPID.  But I think the criticism that the ability isn‚Äôt well set up in the film itself &amp; used prominently to resolve the climactic problem is a valid issue.

@paulscheer @BrianLynch Honestly it would make sense to involve Strickland‚Äôs kid if the movie was partially about the slacker generation.
@BrianLynch @paulscheer I would have cast Paul as Strickland‚Äôs kid who turned out to be the asshole slacker he always screamed about.
@BrianLynch I‚Äôm confused. Why would Marty and doc be disappearing?
@paulscheer @BrianLynch Correct. But BTTF has established that time travel takes time to fade over (Marty doesn‚Äôt just disappear right away) so you could have the same ticking time plot device of them having to fix it before they are erased from existence.
@BrianLynch @IDWPublishing I‚Äôm pretty sure if you pitched it they would. The comic line has actually been pretty fun.
@BrianLynch Now your mission is to come up with the five best jokes for the movie revolving around doc‚Äôs millennial kids in the 1908s not understanding the differences in the 30 year time gap. ;p
@BrianLynch And I‚Äôm guessing the film is really about millennials going back to the 1980‚Äôs?

@JakeMckay Also correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I believe Kylo and Rey share a connected moment, which you‚Äôre suggesting is astral projection, after snoke‚Äôs death, so how is that happening?
@JakeMckay So Snoke can do it but it would kill Luke?
@alindsey4 force lightning was not the resolution to the climactic problem.
@EricDSnider @GermainLussier I also don‚Äôt feel comfortable arguing about this openly on twitter as it‚Äôs spoilers (and even though everyone should have seen this film by now...) and a micro format. Would love to chat about it next week at Sundance in person.
@EricDSnider @GermainLussier I don‚Äôt have a problem with buying that Luke can do it. I don‚Äôt have a problem with adding that ability to canon. I just didn‚Äôt think it was setup well. It felt like magic ability we haven‚Äôt clearly seen before is the solution of film‚Äôs climactic moment. But, just my opinion.

@themetaplexcom We‚Äôve seen that before in Star Wars and is clearly not the same thing as this.
@GermainLussier I‚Äôve heard this explanation 100 times, I don‚Äôt believe this is actually a setup for the ending, and if I‚Äôm wrong, I think it‚Äôs too subtle and not effective in that sense.
@alindsey4 ...and the result of the Force power was pivotal to the ending twist, which something like Force lightning wasn‚Äôt.
@alindsey4 Just because it happened before in a movie in this franchise doesn‚Äôt make that instance bad screenwriting. But honestly I‚Äôd argue the Force lightning doesn‚Äôt seem like a big leap from Force chokes...etc. this was very different than any ability we had seen previously...

@KofiOutlaw @Rufus_Mallard_ @knowsworthy If you want to argue this, sure I can see that... but I still think it‚Äôs very unclear and perhaps too subtle.
@eddielosoyajr @rianjohnson @knowsworthy It was. Oniwan had him blinded in the lightsaber training on the falcon, teaching him to trust his instincts.
@Ethan_Anderton @rianjohnson @knowsworthy Suck up ;p
@rianjohnson @knowsworthy Rian, I love the film and not going to argue here but I do believe it‚Äôs different when something is introduced for the first time as part of the resolution of the climax of a movie. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@knowsworthy @rianjohnson In my mind, I don‚Äôt believe these scenes clearly setup up the concept of astral projection. It does set up the idea of that astral projection would result in death. I also don‚Äôt think at messaging a filmmaker into a conversation like this is cool.
@knowsworthy I think you‚Äôre reaching at very best.

@D_Spevak I saw Get Out. It's a fine film. I dont think it's a particularly GREAT horror film or comedy but loved the social political subtext.

@ShawnErker @craig_walmsley I don‚Äôt think CinemaScore is a good exit score to base this off of. I‚Äôm not saying more people dislike it then like it (I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a small minority) but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a big enough sample.

@craig_walmsley I think they would be concerned if box office showed a big drop because of bad word of mouth but so far that hasn‚Äôt seemed to happen
@HSW3K @AaronColborn @mernmernstein I didn‚Äôt write this article and I mostly loved Last Jedi, and while it might be a better film than Force Awakens, I definitely enjoy TFA more. It‚Äôs no doubt also more rewatchable.
@pauljarman @starwars @RottenTomatoes @EricVespe So the highest sample of public opinion on the movie? I think we can agree upon that.
