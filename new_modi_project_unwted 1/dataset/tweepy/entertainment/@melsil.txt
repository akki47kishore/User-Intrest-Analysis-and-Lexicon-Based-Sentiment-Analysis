@HollyCareBear @chrishemsworth @TessaThompson_x Again, the opportunity is very clear for a white man to be incredibly successful in the current Hollywood blockbuster model. There are now some men of color breaking through, but tell me how many big budget movies have starred women of color?
@RandallLotowycz @chrishemsworth @TessaThompson_x You are most welcome.
For everyone saying that @chrishemsworth should be paid more than @TessaThompson_x because he is a big star and she is not, you are proving my point. The path for white men to become big stars is clear, the path for women of color to be big stars barely exists. That's the point.

@jadewritesbooks The reckoning is bringing heroes down to earth.
It cracks me up that every time a male director says something that is so sexist, and he gets called out for his own statements, I get called a bully. Being it on. It's his own fucking words.
a sci-fi movie where we operate under profoundly different norms. That is what is happening all around us. The norms are shifting. Behaviors are being forced to change. Stories that were shunted to the side are being centered. This is a fucking cultural revolution.
This is an extraordinary moment. And the fact that it has continued for 5 months and that we know others stories that are being worked on that are going to come out just shows how deep this is and how we need profound systemic change. Sometimes it feels like life has become
People are scared. We all get that. Behavior that was acceptable is now out of bounds. Things people have kept pent up inside them for decades is flooding out and this is changing our world. There will be push back at all corners precisely because the stakes are so high.
We are 5 months into a world where women are believed. The power dynamic is shifting in profound ways. 
A reminder that the culture is still giving some men ie - Ryan Seacrest a pass. 
This is not a witch hunt. It is a reckoning.

She's the girl who hates her hair. And she is miserable because her dad is gone and now she can't relate to the world. Her ache for her dad is palpable. And she's also into science. And her warrior spirit and her science brain saves the day. She grows to trust herself. And when
Just back from seeing @WrinkleInTime. Really loved it. Very emotional journey. The movie is so filled with light that it made the cynical bitch in me just smile. Oh and there is glitter, tons and tons of glitter. But seriously, Meg Murry is every girl who just doesn't fit in.

So basically an inclusion rider is for the powerful ie the white men in Hollywood to say to their agents. I want to make sure that we have inclusion in this film I'm going to do. So they put together some goals for intersectional inclusion and they write it into their contracts.

"If we eliminate sexual harassment in Hollywood, then women will only have to deal with harassment all the time in everywhere we go."
#oscars
This monologue is basically previous posts on @WomenaHollywood 
#oscars
The monologue is totally women centric. #oscars
So that whole thing about the #oscars not focusing on #timesup seems like it wasn't true. #oscars
"Here’s how clueless hollywood is about women. We made a movie What Women Want and it starred Mel Gibson." #oscars
@ronaldmacboy @FinalFenwayFict @TheAcademy who the fuck are you?
Why is Matthew McConaughey in the front row?
FYI- Spanx are off.
@TheAcademy I'm not saying I would ask anything about #timesup, but I think you can't stop a press person from asking that.
We have the feed to what is happening in the theatre in the interview room so that means I won't see the commercials. Tell me if anything good happens.
Person giving directions in interview room just said that @TheAcademy wants us to keep questions focused on what is happening on screen and not anything else. 
Just saying - that is bullshit and censorship.

"You made a conscious decision that you’re willing to do something that is personally offensive in order to advance your career." Compares him to Dominque Strauss-Kahn."
The grossest of the gross is represented by the grossest of the gross.
Ladies and gentleman- Benjamin Brafman, the man defending Weinstein
“If a woman decides that she needs to have sex with a Hollywood producer in order to advance her career and actually does it and finds the whole thing offensive, that’s not rape."
The potential for real change is palpable. I want to thank everyone who has been with me for the last decade pushing for change. It hasn't been easy. It won't be easy going forward. But the one thing I know is that there is no going back.
reckoning that is happening all over Hollywood and the world. Women are finally being believed. Women are pushing back in ways that never seemed possible. Stories of people of color are being centered as @JordanPeele said yesterday, "Hollywood is in the midst of a renaissance"
They aspire. And for me to be here, THIS FUCKING YEAR. With the 5th woman to be nominated for best director- go Greta. To be in the press room when they will actually announce a woman's name in that category, I might not be able to keep it together. And let's not forget the
Waking up here in LA on #oscars day and really not believing that I am going to be in the location where the magic happens. Like most folks, I've watched it every year since I was a kid because movies have so much impact on all of us. Movies help teach us to dream. They inspire.

Lynne Ramsay on Her Reputation for “Being Difficult": “If you do that when you’re a guy, you’re seen as artistic — ‘difficulty’ is seen as a sign of genius. But it’s not the same for women.”

Another new member said he would not be voting for Best Actor candidate Gary Oldman, who was accused of domestic abuse...or Kobe Bryant, who was arrested for sexual assault in 2003..“I don’t know why there hasn’t been more scrutiny of their inclusions,..”
I want to meet the woman who said this about @LadyBirdMovie in a dark room
“I was very surprised by the traction that it got. I don’t want to bag it, but is it that people are so desperate to find women directors?” That’s a film where a few years ago you’d see it at Sundance..."
This is why things are changing.

He is VILE.
The gall of Weinstein to actually use the words of Streep and also Jennifer Lawrence who were not abused by him to refute the women were abused by him is INFURIATING. He is trying to dismiss a class action lawsuit and is basically saying- see, I didn't harass or abuse every woman
"The criminal actions he is accused of conducting on the bodies of these women are his responsibility, and if there is any justice left in the system he will pay for them — regardless of how many good movies, made by many good people, Harvey was lucky enough to have acquired..."
Meryl Streep:
"Harvey Weinstein’s attorneys’ use of my (true) statement — that he was not sexually transgressive or physically abusive in our business relationship — as evidence that he was not abusive with many OTHER women is pathetic and exploitive,"

"In 2018, we seem to have woken up in a world ripe for change. If we truly embrace this moment, a line in the sand will turn to stone."
"If you have said “time’s up”, if the stories you have read in the papers have resonated and distressed you – join us in shifting the dial."
Women in the UK use #BAFTAS to join the #timesup movement
"In the very near past, we lived in a world where sexual harassment was an uncomfortable joke; an unavoidable, awkward part of being a girl or a woman. It was certainly not to be discussed, let alone addressed."
Director Barbara Albert:
“For me there must be a quota. There must be 50-50, and if there is, I think it also has to be for festival participation. “It is so sad for me still that [only] four films in competition at Berlinale are by women."

@franklinleonard The thing about it was that it was so natural. Not forced. Coogler has always trusted women and hired them, so it makes sense that he would create a movie where the women were equal to the men.
that the smartest person in the whole country is a young woman. @letitiawright was fantastic. And then @Lupita_Nyongo and #AngelaBassett...so good. And the guys were all pretty awesome too. Ryan Coogler just opened a world of possibilities for other young black girls and boys.
changes the game forever. The film is visually stunning. The story actually works. I got all choked up when I saw @DanaiGurira as the general leading the army. She just killed it. She was just the general, no bullshit about her being a woman. And I cannot say how much I loved

"HW's assistants were exposed to and required to facilitate HW's sex life as a condition of employment.
"Certain of HW's erectile dysfunction injections were charged to HW's corporate credit card"
"HW rewarded some female TWC employees with opportunities for career advancement (including access to meetings and other business
opportunities) based on how attractive they appeared to him on that day, as he himself told the women."
So, so awful to read.
https://t.co/085HsqQzoA
"A third group of predominantly female TWC employees-a group of female executives-also were forced to facilitate HW's sexual conquests.
HW made quid pro quo offers or demands of sexual favors in exchange for career advancement at TWC, or to avoid adverse employment consequences"
https://t.co/ReKiKzAhWc
"HW regularly called female employees "cunt" or "pussy" when he was angry with them or felt they had done a task poorly or incorrectly, or even just instead of calling them by their first names."
"To work for Harvey Weinstein was to work under a persistent barrage of genderbased obscenities, vulgar name-calling, sexualized interactions, threats of violence, and a workplace generally hostile to women."
Reading the NY Attorney General's Civil Rights lawsuit against TWC.
Whoa. As intense as anything that has been written previously.
"HW personally created and perpetuated a work environment permeated with gender-based hostility and inequality."
Burn it down.

@riceunderwater @BBC I'm not even 100% sure of which show I was interviewed for. It was radio and I think I heard them mention Manchester. Sorry.
Last thought on this for today. Uma Thurman is on Broadway now. She has 2 performances today. She is in every scene. Imagine going on stage today having had this article come out. That's guts. I really hope someone gets her flowers.
we all need to let women feel and rage because that rage has been pent up for decades if not centuries. The struggle is to find a new vocabulary for how we move forward. No one has the answer right now. And that is scary. But this is our new reality. No more silence.
And people who want the world to go back to what it was where women were bullied into silence should just forget it. There is a before and an after. There is no going back. We need to keep amplifying women's voices. We need to keep believing women and

This is the lesson of the day from #UmaThurman 
"I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection and that is like the sort of era that we need to evolve out of.”
I agree that it would have been better that the #UmaThurman piece be a news piece that was reported and not an opinion piece. But I still say that we need to focus on what Uma says, not anything else.
Also, I'm thinking that CAA has not paid enough of a price for its complicity in all of this. The apology is not enough. Who were the agents who did this? Are they still working? This piece of the story just can't be glossed over. https://t.co/RijVG4LJ2X
I just hope that the fact that she didn't write an op-ed piece like @salmahayek doesn't obscure the facts of the piece. She was assaulted. I hope we can keep the focus on that. https://t.co/VnxCRW8Rdm

Tarantino to thrive. They both are a part of her story and while Tarantino did not sexually assault her, he did lasting damage and that is just as bad.
Every time I read another one of these startling revelations about what women are put through in Hollywood my heart aches. A stupid shot is not as important as someone's life. Reading this piece it feels to me that the climate created by Harvey allowed the recklessness of
“Harvey assaulted me but that didn’t kill me,” she says. “What really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot.
https://t.co/DMSJzexJQ8
Then Tarantino who wanted to make sure he got a shot with her hair blowing made her drive in a car that was not safe, and it crashed and she has had neck and knee problems ever since.  
“I felt this searing pain and thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m never going to walk again,’
The incredible thing about this piece is that Harvey actually responds and admits “Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals in Paris,”
His definition of a pass is sexual assault.
"Thurman stresses that Creative Artists Agency, her former agency, was connected to Weinstein’s predatory behavior."
On Harvey: “It was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things"
#UmaThurman tells her Harvey story which is also a tale of directorial malfeasance by Tarantino to @maureendowd
